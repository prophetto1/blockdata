# Dev Todos

This folder now uses a 3-file canonical todo system.

## Canonical Files

1. `todos-backlog.md`  
   Master list of all open work.
2. `todos-queue.md`  
   Execution order (`In Progress`, `Next Up`, `Later`).
3. `todos-done-log.md`  
   Completion history and verification notes.

## Operating Rules

1. Keep open checkboxes only in `todos-backlog.md` and `todos-queue.md`.
2. Move completed items to `todos-done-log.md` immediately.
3. Do not track active work in dated legacy docs.

## Reference Folders

1. `archive/`  
   Dated legacy planning/spec/handoff docs (reference-only).
2. `complete/`  
   Evidence snapshots and completed implementation records.
3. `meta-configurator-integration/`  
   Feature-specific reference material.
4. `phase-2-integrations/`  
   Deferred assistant/platform direction docs.
