# Handoff (High-Level)

## Current Working Area
- Primary repo path: `e:/writing-system`
- Active frontend app: `e:/writing-system/web`
- Reference frontend (for behavior/style patterns): `e:/writing-system/front`
- Separate Mage fork (different repo): `e:/mage-ai`

## Direction in Progress
- Frontend shell and side-rail behavior updates in `web`.
- Gradual move away from Mantine-heavy shell patterns toward Tailwind/shadcn-style components (starting with side navigation and related shell chrome).
- `front` is being used as behavioral/design reference for certain shell interactions.

## Scope Boundaries
- Current effort is focused on UI/shell behavior in `web`, not deep backend refactors.
- `mage-ai` remains a separate track and should be treated independently from `writing-system/web` work.

## Open Focus Areas
- Finalize side-rail/menu behavior consistency.
- Finalize extract/config pane scrolling behavior in the active `web` surfaces.
- Keep route-level behavior aligned across Flows/Documents/Database/Schema sections in `web`.

## Practical Continuation Point
- Continue work from `e:/writing-system/web` on shell/navigation/layout behavior first, then page-level polish.
