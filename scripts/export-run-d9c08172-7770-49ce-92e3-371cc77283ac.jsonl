In engineering terms, this is quantization. In practical terms, it means forcing a large numerical space into a small set of discrete buckets. The system remains fluent because the statistical regularities that produce polished prose are robust to compression. What degrades first is the capacity to sustain disciplined, multi-step constraints: tracking exceptions across steps, maintaining logical chains, preserving distinctions that legal reasoning treats as dispositive—_shall_ versus _may_, _must_ versus _may_, the difference between a general rule and a carve-out.

When building plumbing is connected to a municipal water main, a plumber opens the street, installs pipes, and confirms that water flows from the tap. After that, nobody periodically excavates to check whether the upstream water source has changed. As long as clear water comes out of the same faucet, occupants reasonably infer that nothing material has changed. Even if the utility quietly switches from a high-quality source to a cheaper one with more contaminants, the pipes, fixtures, and labels remain the same."}},"annotation":{"schema_ref":"prose_optimizer_v1","schema_uid":"d981fa2ce79f15ada9a64b065dab72ce9fb3427846769c2dac234c1f7ce8a261","data":{}}}
