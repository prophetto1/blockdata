Bolton, post,  p.   410 U. S. 179 , present constitutional challenges to state criminal abortion legislation.  The Texas statutes under attack here are typical of those that have been in effect in many States for approximately a century.  The Georgia statutes, in contrast, have a modern cast, and are a legislative product that, to an extent at least, obviously reflects the influences of recent attitudinal change, of advancing medical knowledge and techniques, and of new thinking about an old issue.\nWe forthwith acknowledge our awareness of the sensitive and emotional nature of the abortion controversy, of the vigorous opposing views, even among physicians, and of the deep and seemingly absolute convictions that the subject inspires.  One's philosophy, one's experiences, one's exposure to the raw edges of human existence, one's religious training, one's attitudes toward life and family and their values, and the moral standards one establishes and seeks to observe, are all likely to influence and to color one's thinking and conclusions about abortion.\nIn addition, population growth, pollution, poverty, and racial overtones tend to complicate and not to simplify the problem.\n\nOur task, of course, is to resolve the issue by constitutional measurement, free of emotion and of predilection.  We seek earnestly to do this, and, because we do, we  \n\n have inquired into, and in this opinion place some emphasis upon, medical and medical-legal history and what that history reveals about man's attitudes toward the abortion procedure over the centuries.  We bear in mind, too, Mr. Justice Holmes' admonition in his now-vindicated dissent in  Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 ,   198 U. S. 76  (1905):\n\"[The Constitution] is made for people of fundamentally differing views, and the accident of our finding certain opinions natural and familiar or novel and even shocking ought not to conclude our judgment upon the question whether statutes embodying them conflict with the Constitution of the United States.\"\n I \n\nThe Texas statutes that concern us here are Arts. 1191-1194 and 1196 of the State's Penal Code. [ Footnote 1 ]  These make it a crime to \"procure an abortion,\" as therein \n\n defined, or to attempt one, except with respect to \"an abortion procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother.\"  Similar statutes are in existence in a majority of the States. [ Footnote 2 ] \n\n\n\nTexas first enacted a criminal abortion statute in 1854.  Texas Laws 1854, c. 49, § 1, set forth in 3 H. Gammel, Laws of Texas 1502 (1898).  This was soon modified into language that has remained substantially unchanged to the present time.   See  Texas Penal Code of 1857, c. 7, Arts. 531-536; G. Paschal, Laws of Texas, Arts. 2192-2197 (1866); Texas Rev.Stat., c. 8, Arts. 536-541 (1879); Texas Rev.Crim.Stat., Arts. 1071-1076 (1911).  The final article in each of these compilations provided the same exception, as does the present Article 1196, for an abortion by \"medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother.\" [ Footnote 3 ] \n\n\n II \nJane Roe, [ Footnote 4 ] a single woman who was residing in Dall. County, Texas, instituted this federal action in March 1970 against the District Attorney of the county.  She sought a declaratory judgment that the Texas criminal abortion statutes were unconstitutional on their face, and an injunction restraining the defendant from enforcing the statutes.\nRoe alleged that she was unmarried and pregnant; that she wished to terminate her pregnancy by an abortion \"performed by a competent, licensed physician, under safe, clinical conditions\"; that she was unable to get a \"legal\" abortion in Texas because her life did not appear to be threatened by the continuation of her pregnancy; and that she could not afford to travel to another jurisdiction in order to secure a legal abortion under safe conditions.  She claimed that the Texas statutes were unconstitutionally vague and that they abridged her right of personal privacy, protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.  By an amendment to her complaint, Roe purported to sue \"on behalf of herself and all other women\" similarly situated.\n\nJames Hubert Hallford, a licensed physician, sought and was granted leave to intervene in Roe's action.  In his complaint, he alleged that he had been arrested previously for violations of the Texas abortion statutes, and \n\n that two such prosecutions were pending against him.  He described conditions of patients who came to him seeking abortions, and he claimed that for many cases he, as a physician, was unable to determine whether they fell within or outside the exception recognized by Article 1196.  He alleged that, as a consequence, the statutes were vague and uncertain, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that they violated his own and his patients' rights to privacy in the doctor-patient relationship and his own right to practice medicine, rights he claimed were guaranteed by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.\nJohn and Mary Doe, [ Footnote 5 ] a married couple, filed a companion complaint to that of Roe.  They also named the District Attorney as defendant, claimed like constitutional deprivations, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  The Does alleged that they were a childless couple; that Mrs. Doe was suffering from a \"neural-chemical\" disorder; that her physician had \"advised her to avoid pregnancy until such time as her condition has materially improved\" (although a pregnancy at the present time would not present \"a serious risk\" to her life); that, pursuant to medical advice, she had discontinued use of birth control pills; and that, if she should become pregnant, she would want to terminate the pregnancy by an abortion performed by a competent, licensed physician under safe, clinical conditions.  By an amendment to their complaint, the Does purported to sue \"on behalf of themselves and all couples similarly situated.\"\n\nThe two actions were consolidated and heard together by a duly convened three-judge district court.  The suits thus presented the situations of the pregnant single woman, the childless couple, with the wife not pregnant, \n\n and the licensed practicing physician, all joining in the attack on the Texas criminal abortion statutes.  Upon the filing of affidavits, motions were made for dismissal and for summary judgment.  The court held that Roe and members of her class, and Dr. Hallford, had standing to sue and presented justiciable controversies, but that the Does had failed to allege facts sufficient to state a present controversy, and did not have standing.  It concluded that, with respect to the requests for a declaratory judgment, abstention was not warranted.  On the merits, the District Court held that the\n\"fundamental right of single women and married persons to choose whether to have children is protected by the Ninth Amendment, through the Fourteenth Amendment,\"\nand that the Texas criminal abortion statutes were void on their face because they were both unconstitutionally vague and constituted an overbroad infringement of the plaintiffs' Ninth Amendment rights.  The court then held that abstention was warranted with respect to the requests for an injunction.  It therefore dismissed the Does' complaint, declared the abortion statutes void, and dismissed the application for injunctive relief.  314 F.Supp. 1217, 1225 (ND Tex.1970).\n\nThe plaintiffs Roe and Doe and the intervenor Hallford, pursuant to 28 U. S. Ct. § 1253, have appealed to this Court from that part of the District Court's judgment denying the injunction.  The defendant District Attorney has purported to cross-appeal, pursuant to the same statute, from the court's grant of declaratory relief to Roe and Hallford.  Both sides also have taken protective appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  That court ordered the appeals held in abeyance pending decision here.  We postponed decision on jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits.  402 U.S. 941 (1971) \n\n\nIt might have been preferable if the defendant, pursuant to our Rule 20, had presented to us a petition for certiorari before judgment in the Court of Appeals with respect to the granting of the plaintiffs' prayer for declaratory relief.  Our decisions in  Mitchell v. Donovan, 398 U. S. 427  (1970), and  Gunn v. University Committee, 399 U. S. 383  (1970), are to the effect that § 1253 does not authorize an appeal to this Court from the grant or denial of declaratory relief alone.  We conclude, nevertheless, that those decisions do not foreclose our review of both the injunctive and the declaratory aspects of a case of this kind when it is properly here, as this one is, on appeal under 1253 from specific denial of injunctive relief, and the arguments as to both aspects are necessarily identical.    See Carter v. Jury Comm'n, 396 U. S. 320  (1970);  Florida Lime Growers v. Jacobsen, 362 U. S. 73 ,   362 U. S. 80 -81 (1960).  It would be destructive of time and energy for all concerned were we to rule otherwise.   Cf. Doe v. Bolton, post,  p.   410 U. S. 179 .\n IV \nWe are next confronted with issues of justiciability, standing, and abstention.  Have Roe and the Does established that \"personal stake in the outcome of the controversy,\"  Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186 ,   369 U. S. 204  (1962), that insures that\n\"the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution,\"\n\n Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83 ,   392 U. S. 101  (1968), and  Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727 ,   405 U. S. 732  (1972)?  And what effect did the pendency of criminal abortion charges against Dr. Hallford in state court have upon the propriety of the federal court's granting relief to him as a plaintiff-intervenor? \n\n\nA.  Jane Roe.   Despite the use of the pseudonym, no suggestion is made that Roe is a fictitious person.  For purposes of her case, we accept as true, and as established, her existence; her pregnant state, as of the inception of her suit in March 1970 and as late as May 21 of that year when she filed an alias affidavit with the District Court; and her inability to obtain a legal abortion in Texas.\nViewing Roe's case as of the time of its filing and thereafter until as late a May, there can be little dispute that it then presented a case or controversy and that, wholly apart from the class aspects, she, as a pregnant single woman thwarted by the Texas criminal abortion laws, had standing to challenge those statutes.   Abele v. Markle,  452 F.2d 1121, 1125 (CA2 1971);  Crossen v. Breckenridge,  446 F.2d 833, 838-839 (CA6 1971);  Poe v. Menghini,  339 F.Supp. 986, 990-991 (Kan.1972).   See Truax v. Raich, 239 U. S. 33  (1915).  Indeed, we do not read the appellee's brief as really asserting anything to the contrary.  The \"logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated,\"  Flast v. Cohen,  392 U.S. at 102 , and the necessary degree of contentiousness,  Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U. S. 103  (1969), are both present.\n\nThe appellee notes, however, that the record does not disclose that Roe was pregnant at the time of the District Court hearing on May 22, 1970, [ Footnote 6 ] or on the following June 17 when the court's opinion and judgment were filed.  And he suggests that Roe's case must now be moot because she and all other members of her class are no longer subject to any 1970 pregnancy. \n\n\nThe usual rule in federal cases is that an actual controversy must exist at stages of appellate or certiorari review, and not simply at the date the action is initiated.   United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36  (1950);  Golden v. Zwickler, supra; SEC v. Medical Committee for Human Rights, 404 U. S. 403  (1972).\nBut when, as here, pregnancy is a significant fact in the litigation, the normal 266-day human gestation period is so short that the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is complete.  If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied.  Our law should not be that rigid.  Pregnancy often comes more than once to the same woman, and in the general population, if man is to survive, it will always be with us.  Pregnancy provides a classic justification for a conclusion of nonmootness.  It truly could be \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\"   Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S. 498 ,   219 U. S. 515  (1911).   See Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U. S. 814 ,   394 U. S. 816  (1969);  Carroll v. Princess Anne, 393 U. S. 175 ,   393 U. S. 178 -179 (1968);  United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629 ,   345 U. S. 632 -633 (1953).\nWe, therefore, agree with the District Court that Jane Roe had standing to undertake this litigation, that she presented a justiciable controversy, and that the termination of her 1970 pregnancy has not rendered her case moot.\nB.  Dr. Hallford.   The doctor's position is different.  He entered Roe's litigation as a plaintiff-intervenor, alleging in his complaint that he:\n\n\"[I]n the past has been arrested for violating the Texas Abortion Laws and at the present time stands charged by indictment with violating said laws in the Criminal District Court of Dall. County, Texas to-wit:  (1) The State of Texas vs. \n  \n James H. Hallford, No. C-69-5307-IH, and (2) The State of Texas vs. James H. Hallford, No. C-692524-H.  In both cases, the defendant is charged with abortion. . . .\"\nIn his application for leave to intervene, the doctor made like representations as to the abortion charges pending in the state court.  These representations were also repeated in the affidavit he executed and filed in support of his motion for summary judgment.\nDr. Hallford is, therefore, in the position of seeking, in a federal court, declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the same statutes under which he stands charged in criminal prosecutions simultaneously pending in state court.  Although he stated that he has been arrested in the past for violating the State's abortion laws, he makes no allegation of any substantial and immediate threat to any federally protected right that cannot be asserted in his defense against the state prosecutions.  Neither is there any allegation of harassment or bad faith prosecution.  In order to escape the rule articulated in the cases cited in the next paragraph of this opinion that, absent harassment and bad faith, a defendant in a pending state criminal case cannot affirmatively challenge in federal court the statutes under which the State is prosecuting him, Dr. Hallford seeks to distinguish his status as a present state defendant from his status as a \"potential future defendant,\" and to assert only the latter for standing purposes here.\n\nWe see no merit in that distinction.  Our decision in  Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U. S. 66  (1971), compels the conclusion that the District Court erred when it granted declaratory relief to Dr. Hallford instead of refraining from so doing.  The court, of course, was correct in refusing to grant injunctive relief to the doctor.  The reasons supportive of that action, however, are those expressed in  Samuels v. Mackell, supra,  and in  Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37  (1971);  Boyle v. Landry, 401 U. S. 77  (1971);  Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U. S. 82  (1971); and  Byrne v. Karaleis, 401 U. S. 216  (1971).   See also Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479  (1965).  We note, in passing, that  Younger  and its companion cases were decided after the three-judge District Court decision in this case.\nDr. Hallford's complaint in intervention, therefore, is to be dismissed. [ Footnote 7 ]  He is remitted to his defenses in the state criminal proceedings against him.  We reverse the judgment of the District Court insofar as it granted Dr. Hallford relief and failed to dismiss his complaint in intervention.\nC.  The Does.   In view of our ruling as to Roe's standing in her case, the issue of the Does' standing in their case has little significance.  The claims they assert are essentially the same as those of Roe, and they attack the same statutes.  Nevertheless, we briefly note the Does' posture.\n\nTheir pleadings present them as a childless married couple, the woman not being pregnant, who have no desire to have children at this time because of their having received medical advice that Mrs. Doe should avoid pregnancy, and for \"other highly personal reasons.\"  But they \"fear . . . they may face the prospect of becoming \n\n parents.\"  And if pregnancy ensues, they \"would want to terminate\" it by an abortion.  They assert an inability to obtain an abortion legally in Texas and, consequently, the prospect of obtaining an illegal abortion there or of going outside Texas to some place where the procedure could be obtained legally and competently.\nWe thus have as plaintiffs a married couple who have, as their asserted immediate and present injury, only an alleged \"detrimental effect upon [their] marital happiness\" because they are forced to \"the choice of refraining from normal sexual relations or of endangering Mary Doe's health through a possible pregnancy.\"  Their claim is that, sometime in the future, Mrs. Doe might become pregnant because of possible failure of contraceptive measures, and, at that time in the future, she might want an abortion that might then be illegal under the Texas statutes.\n\nThis very phrasing of the Does' position reveals its speculative character.  Their alleged injury rests on possible future contraceptive failure, possible future pregnancy, possible future unpreparedness for parenthood, and possible future impairment of health.  Any one or more of these several possibilities may not take place, and all may not combine.  In the Does' estimation, these possibilities might have some real or imagined impact upon their marital happiness.  But we are not prepared to say that the bare allegation of so indirect an injury is sufficient to present an actual case or controversy.   Younger v. Harris,  401 U.S. at 41 -42;  Golden v. Zwickler,  394 U.S. at 109 -110;  Abele v. Markle,  452 F.2d at 1124-1125;  Crossen v. Breckenridge,  446 F.2d at 839.  The Does' claim falls far short of those resolved otherwise in the cases that the Does urge upon us, namely,  Investment Co. Institute v. Camp, 401 U. S. 617  (1971);  Data Processing Service v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150  (1970); \n\n and  Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97  (1968).   See also Truax v. Raich, 239 U. S. 33  (1915).\nThe Does therefore are not appropriate plaintiffs in this litigation.  Their complaint was properly dismissed by the District Court, and we affirm that dismissal.\n V \nThe principal thrust of appellant's attack on the Texas statutes is that they improperly invade a right, said to be possessed by the pregnant woman, to choose to terminate her pregnancy.  Appellant would discover this right in the concept of personal \"liberty\" embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause; or in personal, marital, familial, and sexual privacy said to be protected by the Bill of Rights or its penumbras,  see Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479  (1965);  Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438  (1972);  id.  at 460  (WHITE, J., concurring in result); or among those rights reserved to the people by the Ninth Amendment,  Griswold v. Connecticut,  381 U.S. at 486  (Goldberg, J., concurring).  Before addressing this claim, we feel it desirable briefly to survey, in several aspects, the history of abortion, for such insight as that history may afford us, and then to examine the state purposes and interests behind the criminal abortion laws.\n VI \n\nIt perhaps is not generally appreciated that the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage.  Those laws, generally proscribing abortion or its attempt at any time during pregnancy except when necessary to preserve the pregnant woman's life, are not of ancient or even of common law origin.  Instead, they derive from statutory changes effected, for the most part, in the latter half of the 19th century. \n\n\n1.  Ancient attitudes.   These are not capable of precise determination.  We are told that, at the time of the Persian Empire, abortifacients were known, and that criminal abortions were severely punished. [ Footnote 8 ]  We are also told, however, that abortion was practiced in Greek times as well as in the Roman Era, [ Footnote 9 ] and that \"it was resorted to without scruple.\" [ Footnote 10 ]  The Ephesian, Soranos, often described as the greatest of the ancient gynecologists, appears to have been generally opposed to Rome's prevailing free-abortion practices.  He found it necessary to think first of the life of the mother, and he resorted to abortion when, upon this standard, he felt the procedure advisable. [ Footnote 11 ]  Greek and Roman law afforded little protection to the unborn.  If abortion was prosecuted in some places, it seems to have been based on a concept of a violation of the father's right to his offspring.  Ancient religion did not bar abortion. [ Footnote 12 ]\n\n2.  The Hippocratic Oath.   What then of the famous Oath that has stood so long as the ethical guide of the medical profession and that bears the name of the great Greek (460(?)-377(?) B. C.), who has been described \n\n as the Father of Medicine, the \"wisest and the greatest practitioner of his art,\" and the \"most important and most complete medical personality of antiquity,\" who dominated the medical schools of his time, and who typified the sum of the medical knowledge of the past? [ Footnote 13 ]  The Oath varies somewhat according to the particular translation, but in any translation the content is clear:\n\"I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and in like manner, I will not give to a woman a pessary to produce abortion, [ Footnote 14 ]\"\nor\n\"I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect.  Similarly, I will not give to a woman an abortive remedy. [ Footnote 15 ]\"\n\nAlthough the Oath is not mentioned in any of the principal briefs in this case or in  Doe v. Bolton, post,  p.   410 U. S. 179 , it represents the apex of the development of strict ethical concepts in medicine, and its influence endures to this day.  Why did not the authority of Hippocrates dissuade abortion practice in his time and that of Rome?  The late Dr. Edelstein provides us with a theory: [ Footnote 16 ]  The Oath was not uncontested even in Hippocrates' day; only the Pythagorean school of philosophers frowned upon the related act of suicide.  Most Greek thinkers, on the other hand, commended abortion, at least prior to viability.   See  Plato, Republic, V, 461; Aristotle, Politics, VII, 1335b 25.  For the Pythagoreans, however, it was a matter of dogma.  For them, the embryo was animate from the moment of conception, and abortion meant destruction of a living being.  The abortion clause of the Oath, therefore, \"echoes Pythagorean doctrines,\" \n\n and \"[i]n no other stratum of Greek opinion were such views held or proposed in the same spirit of uncompromising austerity.\" [ Footnote 17 ]\nDr. Edelstein then concludes that the Oath originated in a group representing only a small segment of Greek opinion, and that it certainly was not accepted by all ancient physicians.  He points out that medical writings down to Galen (A.D. 130-200) \"give evidence of the violation of almost every one of its injunctions.\" [ Footnote 18 ]  But with the end of antiquity, a decided change took place.  Resistance against suicide and against abortion became common.  The Oath came to be popular.  The emerging teachings of Christianity were in agreement with the Pythagorean ethic.  The Oath \"became the nucleus of all medical ethics,\" and \"was applauded as the embodiment of truth.\"  Thus, suggests Dr. Edelstein, it is \"a Pythagorean manifesto, and not the expression of an absolute standard of medical conduct.\" [ Footnote 19 ]\nThis, it seems to us, is a satisfactory and acceptable explanation of the Hippocratic Oath's apparent rigidity.  It enables us to understand, in historical context, a long-accepted and revered statement of medical ethics.\n\n3.  The common law.   It is undisputed that, at common law, abortion performed before \"quickening\" -- the first recognizable movement of the fetus  in utero,  appearing usually from the 16th to the 18th week of pregnancy [ Footnote 20 ] -- was not an indictable offense. [ Footnote 21 ]  The absence \n\n of a common law crime for pre-quickening abortion appears to have developed from a confluence of earlier philosophical, theological, and civil and canon law concepts of when life begins.  These disciplines variously approached the question in terms of the point at which the embryo or fetus became \"formed\" or recognizably human, or in terms of when a \"person\" came into being, that is, infused with a \"soul\" or \"animated.\"  A loose consensus evolved in early English law that these events occurred at some point between conception and live birth. [ Footnote 22 ]  This was \"mediate animation.\"  Although \n\n Christian theology and the canon law came to fix the point of animation at 40 days for a male and 80 days for a female, a view that persisted until the 19th century, there was otherwise little agreement about the precise time of formation or animation.  There was agreement, however, that, prior to this point, the fetus was to be regarded as part of the mother, and its destruction, therefore, was not homicide.  Due to continued uncertainty about the precise time when animation occurred, to the lack of any empirical basis for the 40-80-day view, and perhaps to Aquinas' definition of movement as one of the two first principles of life, Bracton focused upon quickening as the critical point.  The significance of quickening was echoed by later common law scholars, and found its way into the received common law in this country.\n\nWhether abortion of a quick fetus was a felony at common law, or even a lesser crime, is still disputed.  Bracton, writing early in the 13th century, thought it homicide. [ Footnote 23 ]  But the later and predominant view, following the great common law scholars, has been that it was, at most, a lesser offense.  In a frequently cited \n\n passage, Coke took the position that abortion of a woman \"quick with childe\" is \"a great misprision, and no murder.\" [ Footnote 24 ]  Blackstone followed, saying that, while abortion after quickening had once been considered manslaughter (though not murder), \"modern law\" took a less severe view. [ Footnote 25 ]  A recent review of the common law precedents argues, however, that those precedents contradict Coke, and that even post-quickening abortion was never established as a common law crime. [ Footnote 26 ]  This is of some importance, because, while most American courts ruled, in holding or dictum, that abortion of an unquickened fetus was not criminal under their received common law, [ Footnote 27 ] others followed Coke in stating that abortion \n\n of a quick fetus was a \"misprision,\" a term they translated to mean \"misdemeanor.\" [ Footnote 28 ]  That their reliance on Coke on this aspect of the law was uncritical and, apparently in all the reported cases, dictum (due probably to the paucity of common law prosecutions for post-quickening abortion), makes it now appear doubtful that abortion was ever firmly established as a common law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus.\n\n4.  The English statutory law.   England's first criminal abortion statute, Lord Ellenborough's Act, 43 Geo. 3, c. 58, came in 1803.  It made abortion of a quick fetus, § 1, a capital crime, but, in § 2, it provided lesser penalties for the felony of abortion before quickening, and thus preserved the \"quickening\" distinction.  This contrast was continued in the general revision of 1828, 9 Geo. 4, c. 31, § 13.  It disappeared, however, together with the death penalty, in 1837, 7 Will. 4 & 1 Vict., c. 85. § 6, and did not reappear in the Offenses Against the Person Act of 1861, 24 & 25 Vict., c. 100, § 59, that formed the core of English anti-abortion law until the liberalizing reforms of 1967.  In 1929, the Infant Life (Preservation) Act, 19 & 20 Geo. 5, c. 34, came into being.  Its emphasis was upon the destruction of \"the life of a child capable of being born alive.\"  It made a willful act performed with the necessary intent a felony.  It contained a proviso that one was not to be \n\n found guilty of the offense\n\"unless it is proved that the act which caused the death of the child was not done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother.\"\nA seemingly notable development in the English law was the case of  Rex v. Bourne,  [1939] 1 K.B. 687.  This case apparently answered in the affirmative the question whether an abortion necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman was excepted from the criminal penalties of the 1861 Act.  In his instructions to the jury, Judge Macnaghten referred to the 1929 Act, and observed that that Act related to \"the case where a child is killed by a willful act at the time when it is being delivered in the ordinary course of nature.\"   Id.  at 691.  He concluded that the 1861 Act's use of the word \"unlawfully,\" imported the same meaning expressed by the specific proviso in the 1929 Act, even though there was no mention of preserving the mother's life in the 1861 Act.  He then construed the phrase \"preserving the life of the mother\" broadly, that is, \"in a reasonable sense,\" to include a serious and permanent threat to the mother's health, and instructed the jury to acquit Dr. Bourne if it found he had acted in a good faith belief that the abortion was necessary for this purpose.   Id.  at 693-694.  The jury did acquit.\nRecently, Parliament enacted a new abortion law.  This is the Abortion Act of 1967, 15 & 16 Eliz. 2, c. 87.  The Act permits a licensed physician to perform an abortion where two other licensed physicians agree (a)\n\"that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, or of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated,\"\nor (b)\n\n\"that there is a substantial risk that, if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as \n  \n to be seriously handicapped.\"\nThe Act also provides that, in making this determination, \"account may be taken of the pregnant woman's actual or reasonably foreseeable environment.\"  It also permits a physician, without the concurrence of others, to terminate a pregnancy where he is of the good faith opinion that the abortion \"is immediately necessary to save the life or to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman.\"\n5.  The American law.   In this country, the law in effect in all but a few States until mid-19th century was the preexisting English common law.  Connecticut, the first State to enact abortion legislation, adopted in 1821 that part of Lord Ellenborough's Act that related to a woman \"quick with child.\" [ Footnote 29 ]  The death penalty was not imposed.  Abortion before quickening was made a crime in that State only in 1860. [ Footnote 30 ]  In 1828, New York enacted legislation [ Footnote 31 ] that, in two respects, was to serve as a model for early anti-abortion statutes.  First, while barring destruction of an unquickened fetus as well as a quick fetus, it made the former only a misdemeanor, but the latter second-degree manslaughter.  Second, it incorporated a concept of therapeutic abortion by providing that an abortion was excused if it\n\"shall have been necessary to preserve the life of such mother, or shall have been advised by two physicians to be necessary for such purpose.\"\n\nBy 1840, when Texas had received the common law, [ Footnote 32 ] only eight American States \n\n had statutes dealing with abortion. [ Footnote 33 ]  It was not until after the War Between the States that legislation began generally to replace the common law.  Most of these initial statutes dealt severely with abortion after quickening, but were lenient with it before quickening.  Most punished attempts equally with completed abortions.  While many statutes included the exception for an abortion thought by one or more physicians to be necessary to save the mother's life, that provision soon disappeared, and the typical law required that the procedure actually be necessary for that purpose.  Gradually, in the middle and late 19th century, the quickening distinction disappeared from the statutory law of most States and the degree of the offense and the penalties were increased.  By the end of the 1950's, a large majority of the jurisdictions banned abortion, however and whenever performed, unless done to save or preserve the life of the mother. [ Footnote 34 ]  The exceptions, Alabama and the District of Columbia, permitted abortion to preserve the mother's health. [ Footnote 35 ]  Three States permitted abortions that were not \"unlawfully\" performed or that were not \"without lawful justification,\" leaving interpretation of those standards to the courts. [ Footnote 36 ]  In \n\n the past several years, however, a trend toward liberalization of abortion statutes has resulted in adoption, by about one-third of the States, of less stringent laws, most of them patterned after the ALI Model Penal Code, § 230.3, [ Footnote 37 ] set forth as Appendix B to the opinion in  Doe v. Bolton, post,  p.   410 U. S. 205 .\n\nIt is thus apparent that, at common law, at the time of the adoption of our Constitution, and throughout the major portion of the 19th century, abortion was viewed with less disfavor than under most American statutes currently in effect.  Phrasing it another way, a woman enjoyed a substantially broader right to terminate a pregnancy than she does in most States today.  At least with respect to the early stage of pregnancy, and very possibly without such a limitation, the opportunity \n\n to make this choice was present in this country well into the 19th century.  Even later, the law continued for some time to treat less punitively an abortion procured in early pregnancy.\n6.  The position of the American Medical Association.   The anti-abortion mood prevalent in this country in the late 19th century was shared by the medical profession.  Indeed, the attitude of the profession may have played a significant role in the enactment of stringent criminal abortion legislation during that period.\nAn AMA Committee on Criminal Abortion was appointed in May, 1857.  It presented its report, 12 Trans. of the Am.Med.Assn. 778 (1859), to the Twelfth Annual Meeting.  That report observed that the Committee had been appointed to investigate criminal abortion \"with a view to its general suppression.\"  It deplored abortion and its frequency and it listed three causes of \"this general demoralization\":\n\"The first of these causes is a widespread popular ignorance of the true character of the crime -- a belief, even among mothers themselves, that the foetus is not alive till after the period of quickening.\"\n\"The second of the agents alluded to is the fact that the profession themselves are frequently supposed careless of foetal life. . . .\"\n\n\"The third reason of the frightful extent of this crime is found in the grave defects of our laws, both common and statute, as regards the independent and actual existence of the child before birth, as a living being.  These errors, which are sufficient in most instances to prevent conviction, are based, and only based, upon mistaken and exploded medical dogmas.  With strange inconsistency, the law fully acknowledges the foetus  in utero  and its inherent rights, for civil purposes; while personally and as criminally affected, it fails to recognize it, \n  \n and to its life as yet denies all protection.\"\n Id.  at 776.  The Committee then offered, and the Association adopted, resolutions protesting \"against such unwarrantable destruction of human life,\" calling upon state legislatures to revise their abortion laws, and requesting the cooperation of state medical societies \"in pressing the subject.\"   Id.  at 28, 78.\nIn 1871, a long and vivid report was submitted by the Committee on Criminal Abortion.  It ended with the observation,\n\"We had to deal with human life.  In a matter of less importance, we could entertain no compromise.  An honest judge on the bench would call things by their proper names.  We could do no less.\"\n22 Trans. of the Am.Med.Assn. 268 (1871).  It proffered resolutions, adopted by the Association,  id.  at 38-39, recommending, among other things, that it\n\"be unlawful and unprofessional for any physician to induce abortion or premature labor without the concurrent opinion of at least one respectable consulting physician, and then always with a view to the safety of the child -- if that be possible,\"\nand calling\n\"the attention of the clergy of all denominations to the perverted views of morality entertained by a large class of females -- aye, and men also, on this important question.\"\n\nExcept for periodic condemnation of the criminal abortionist, no further formal AMA action took place until 1967.  In that year, the Committee on Human Reproduction urged the adoption of a stated policy of opposition to induced abortion except when there is \"documented medical evidence\" of a threat to the health or life of the mother, or that the child \"may be born with incapacitating physical deformity or mental deficiency,\" or that a pregnancy \"resulting from legally established statutory or forcible rape or incest may constitute a threat to the mental or physical health of the \n\n patient,\" two other physicians \"chosen because of their recognized professional competence have examined the patient and have concurred in writing,\" and the procedure \"is performed in a hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals.\"  The providing of medical information by physicians to state legislatures in their consideration of legislation regarding therapeutic abortion was \"to be considered consistent with the principles of ethics of the American Medical Association.\"  This recommendation was adopted by the House of Delegates.  Proceedings of the AMA House of Delegates 40-51 (June 1967).\n\nIn 1970, after the introduction of a variety of proposed resolutions and of a report from its Board of Trustees, a reference committee noted \"polarization of the medical profession on this controversial issue\"; division among those who had testified; a difference of opinion among AMA councils and.committees; \"the remarkable shift in testimony\" in six months, felt to be influenced \"by the rapid changes in state laws and by the judicial decisions which tend to make abortion more freely available; \" and a feeling \"that this trend will continue.\"  On June 25, 1970, the House of Delegates adopted preambles and most of the resolutions proposed by the reference committee.  The preambles emphasized \"the best interests of the patient,\" \"sound clinical judgment,\" and \"informed patient consent,\" in contrast to \"mere acquiescence to the patient's demand.\"  The resolutions asserted that abortion is a medical procedure that should be performed by a licensed physician in an accredited hospital only after consultation with two other physicians and in conformity with state law, and that no party to the procedure should be required to violate personally held moral principles. [ Footnote 38 ]  Proceedings \n\n of the AMA House of Delegates 220 (June 1970).  The AMA Judicial Council rendered a complementary opinion. [ Footnote 39 ]\n7.  The position of the American Public Health Association.   In October, 1970, the Executive Board of the APHA adopted Standards for Abortion Services.  These were five in number:\n\n\"a. Rapid and simple abortion referral must be readily available through state and local public \n  \n health departments, medical societies, or other nonprofit organizations.\"\n\"b. An important function of counseling should be to simplify and expedite the provision of abortion services; it should not delay the obtaining of these services.\"\n\"c. Psychiatric consultation should not be mandatory.  As in the case of other specialized medical services, psychiatric consultation should be sought for definite indications, and not on a routine basis.\"\n\"d. A wide range of individuals from appropriately trained, sympathetic volunteers to highly skilled physicians may qualify as abortion counselors.\"\n\"e. Contraception and/or sterilization should be discussed with each abortion patient.\"\n\"Recommended Standards for Abortion Services, 61 Am.J.Pub.Health 396 (1971).  Among factors pertinent to life and health risks associated with abortion were three that 'are recognized as important':  \"\n\"a. the skill of the physician,\"\n\"b. the environment in which the abortion is performed, and above all\"\n\"c. the duration of pregnancy, as determined by uterine size and confirmed by menstrual history.\"\n Id.  at 397.\nIt was said that \"a well equipped hospital\" offers more protection\n\"to cope with unforeseen difficulties than an office or clinic without such resources. . . .  The factor of gestational age is of overriding importance.\"\n\nThus, it was recommended that abortions in the second trimester and early abortions in the presence of existing medical complications be performed in hospitals as inpatient procedures.  For pregnancies in the first trimester, \n\n abortion in the hospital with or without overnight stay \"is probably the safest practice.\"  An abortion in an extramural facility, however, is an acceptable alternative \"provided arrangements exist in advance to admit patients promptly if unforeseen complications develop.\"  Standards for an abortion facility were listed.  It was said that, at present, abortions should be performed by physicians or osteopaths who are licensed to practice and who have \"adequate training.\"   Id.  at 398.\n\n8.  The position of the American Bar Association.   At its meeting in February, 1972, the ABA House of Delegates approved, with 17 opposing votes, the Uniform Abortion Act that had been drafted and approved the preceding August by the Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.  58 A.B.A.J. 380 (1972).  We set forth the Act in full in the margin. [ Footnote 40 ]  The \n\n Opinion of the Court Conference has appended an enlightening Prefatory Note. [ Footnote 41 ]\n VII \n\nThree reasons have been advanced to explain historically the enactment of criminal abortion laws in the 19th century and to justify their continued existence. \n\n\nIt has been argued occasionally that these laws were the product of a Victorian social concern to discourage illicit sexual conduct.  Texas, however, does not advance this justification in the present case, and it appears that no court or commentator has taken the argument seriously. [ Footnote 42 ]  The appellants and  amici  contend, moreover, that this is not a proper state purpose, at all and suggest that, if it were, the Texas statutes are overbroad in protecting it, since the law fails to distinguish between married and unwed mothers.\n\nA second reason is concerned with abortion as a medical procedure.  When most criminal abortion laws were first enacted, the procedure was a hazardous one for the woman. [ Footnote 43 ]  This was particularly true prior to the \n\n development of antisepsis.  Antiseptic techniques, of course, were based on discoveries by Lister, Pasteur, and others first announced in 1867, but were not generally accepted and employed until about the turn of the century.  Abortion mortality was high.  Even after 1900, and perhaps until as late as the development of antibiotics in the 1940's, standard modern techniques such as dilation and curettage were not nearly so safe as they are today.  Thus, it has been argued that a State's real concern in enacting a criminal abortion law was to protect the pregnant woman, that is, to restrain her from submitting to a procedure that placed her life in serious jeopardy.\n\nModern medical techniques have altered this situation.  Appellants and various  amici  refer to medical data indicating that abortion in early pregnancy, that is, prior to the end of the first trimester, although not without its risk, is now relatively safe.  Mortality rates for women undergoing early abortions, where the procedure is legal, appear to be as low as or lower than the rates for normal childbirth. [ Footnote 44 ]  Consequently, any interest of the State in protecting the woman from an inherently hazardous procedure, except when it would be equally dangerous for her to forgo it, has largely disappeared.  Of course, important state interests in the areas of health and medical standards do remain.  \n\n The State has a legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion, like any other medical procedure, is performed under circumstances that insure maximum safety for the patient.  This interest obviously extends at least to the performing physician and his staff, to the facilities involved, to the availability of after-care, and to adequate provision for any complication or emergency that might arise.  The prevalence of high mortality rates at illegal \"abortion mills\" strengthens, rather than weakens, the State's interest in regulating the conditions under which abortions are performed.  Moreover, the risk to the woman increases as her pregnancy continues.  Thus, the State retains a definite interest in protecting the woman's own health and safety when an abortion is proposed at a late stage of pregnancy.\n\nThe third reason is the State's interest -- some phrase it in terms of duty -- in protecting prenatal life.  Some of the argument for this justification rests on the theory that a new human life is present from the moment of conception. [ Footnote 45 ]  The State's interest and general obligation to protect life then extends, it is argued, to prenatal life.  Only when the life of the pregnant mother herself is at stake, balanced against the life she carries within her, should the interest of the embryo or fetus not prevail.  Logically, of course, a legitimate state interest in this area need not stand or fall on acceptance of the belief that life begins at conception or at some other point prior to live birth.  In assessing the State's interest, recognition may be given to the less rigid claim that as long as at least potential life is involved, the State may assert interests beyond the protection of the pregnant woman alone. \n\n\n\nParties challenging state abortion laws have sharply disputed in some courts the contention that a purpose of these laws, when enacted, was to protect prenatal life. [ Footnote 46 ]  Pointing to the absence of legislative history to support the contention, they claim that most state laws were designed solely to protect the woman.  Because medical advances have lessened this concern, at least with respect to abortion in early pregnancy, they argue that with respect to such abortions the laws can no longer be justified by any state interest.  There is some scholarly support for this view of original purpose. [ Footnote 47 ]  The few state courts called upon to interpret their laws in the late 19th and early 20th centuries did focus on the State's interest in protecting the woman's health, rather than in preserving the embryo and fetus. [ Footnote 48 ]  Proponents of this view point out that in many States, including Texas, [ Footnote 49 ] by statute or judicial interpretation, the pregnant woman herself could not be prosecuted for self-abortion or for cooperating in an abortion performed upon her by another. [ Footnote 50 ]  They claim that adoption of the \"quickening\" distinction through received common \n\n law and state statutes tacitly recognizes the greater health hazards inherent in late abortion and impliedly repudiates the theory that life begins at conception.\nIt is with these interests, and the eight to be attached to them, that this case is concerned.\n VIII \n\nThe Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy.  In a line of decisions, however, going back perhaps as far as  Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U. S. 250 ,   141 U. S. 251  (1891), the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution.  In varying contexts, the Court or individual Justices have, indeed, found at least the roots of that right in the First Amendment,  Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557 ,   394 U. S. 564  (1969); in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments,  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 ,   392 U. S. 8 -9 (1968),  Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 ,   389 U. S. 350  (1967),  Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616  (1886),  see Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 ,   277 U. S. 478  (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights,  Griswold v. Connecticut,  381 U.S. at 484 -485; in the Ninth Amendment,  id.  at 486  (Goldberg, J., concurring); or in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment,  see Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 ,   262 U. S. 399  (1923).  These decisions make it clear that only personal rights that can be deemed \"fundamental\" or \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\"  Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319 ,   302 U. S. 325  (1937), are included in this guarantee of personal privacy.  They also make it clear that the right has some extension to activities relating to marriage,  Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 ,   388 U. S. 12  (1967); procreation,  Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U. S. 535 ,   316 U. S. 541 -542 (1942); contraception,  Eisenstadt v. Baird,  405 U.S. at 453 -454;  id.  at 460 ,   405 U. S. 463 -465 \n\n (WHITE, J., concurring in result); family relationships,  Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158 ,   321 U. S. 166  (1944); and childrearing and education,  Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 ,   268 U. S. 535  (1925),  Meyer v. Nebraska, supra. \nThis right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.  The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent. Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved.  Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future.  Psychological harm may be imminent.  Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care.  There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it.  In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved.  All these are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation.\n\nOn the basis of elements such as these, appellant and some  amici  argue that the woman's right is absolute and that she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way, and for whatever reason she alone chooses.  With this we do not agree.  Appellant's arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all in regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman's sole determination, are unpersuasive.  The \n\n Court's decisions recognizing a right of privacy also acknowledge that some state regulation in areas protected by that right is appropriate.  As noted above, a State may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life.  At some point in pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision.  The privacy right involved, therefore, cannot be said to be absolute.  In fact, it is not clear to us that the claim asserted by some  amici  that one has an unlimited right to do with one's body as one pleases bears a close relationship to the right of privacy previously articulated in the Court's decisions.  The Court has refused to recognize an unlimited right of this kind in the past.   Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11  (1905) (vaccination);  Buck v. Bell, 274 U. S. 200  (1927) ( sterilization).\nWe, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified, and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.\n\nWe note that those federal and state courts that have recently considered abortion law challenges have reached the same conclusion.  A majority, in addition to the District Court in the present case, have held state laws unconstitutional, at least in part, because of vagueness or because of overbreadth and abridgment of rights.   Abele v. Markle,  342 F.Supp. 800 (Conn.1972),  appeal docketed,  No. 72-56;  Abele v. Markle,  351 F.Supp. 224 (Conn.1972),  appeal docketed,  No. 72-730;  Doe v. Bolton,  319 F.Supp. 1048 (ND Ga.1970),  appeal decided today, post,  p.   410 U. S. 179 ;  Doe v. Scott,  321 F.Supp. 1385 (ND Ill.1971),  appeal docketed,  No. 70-105;  Poe v.

Belous,  71 Cal.2d 954, 458 P.2d 194 (1969),  cert. denied,  397 U.S. 915 (1970);  State v. Barquet,  262 So.2d 431 (Fla.1972).\nOthers have sustained state statutes.   Crossen v. Attorney General,  344 F.Supp. 587 (ED Ky.1972),  appeal docketed,  No. 72-256;  Rosen v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners,  318 F.Supp. 1217 (ED La.1970),  appeal docketed,  No. 70-42;  Corkey v. Edwards,  322 F.Supp. 1248 (WDNC 1971),  appeal docketed,  No. 71-92;  Steinberg v. Brown,  321 F.Supp. 741 (ND Ohio 1970);  Doe v. Rampton  (Utah 1971),  appeal docketed,  No. 71-5666;  Cheaney v. State,  ___ Ind. ___, 285 N.E.2d 265 (1972);  Spears v. State,  257 So.2d 876 (Miss. 1972);  State v. Munson,  86 S.D. 663, 201 N.W.2d 123 (1972),  appeal docketed,  No. 72-631.\nAlthough the results are divided, most of these courts have agreed that the right of privacy, however based, is broad enough to cover the abortion decision; that the right, nonetheless, is not absolute, and is subject to some limitations; and that, at some point, the state interests as to protection of health, medical standards, and prenatal life, become dominant.  We agree with this approach.\n\nWhere certain \"fundamental rights\" are involved, the Court has held that regulation limiting these rights may be justified only by a \"compelling state interest,\"  Kramer v. Union Free School District, 395 U. S. 621 ,   395 U. S. 627  (1969);  Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618 ,   394 U. S. 634  (1969),  Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 ,   374 U. S. 406  (1963), and that legislative enactments must be narrowly drawn to express only the legitimate state interests at stake.   Griswold v. Connecticut,  381 U.S. at 485 ;  Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500 ,   378 U. S. 508  (1964);  Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296 ,   310 U. S. 307 -308 (1940);  see Eisenstadt v. Baird,  405 U.S. at 460 , 463-464 (WHITE, J., concurring in result).\nIn the recent abortion cases cited above, courts have recognized these principles.  Those striking down state laws have generally scrutinized the State's interests in protecting health and potential life, and have concluded that neither interest justified broad limitations on the reasons for which a physician and his pregnant patient might decide that she should have an abortion in the early stages of pregnancy.  Courts sustaining state laws have held that the State's determinations to protect health or prenatal life are dominant and constitutionally justifiable.\n IX \nThe District Court held that the appellee failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the Texas statute's infringement upon Roe's rights was necessary to support a compelling state interest, and that, although the appellee presented \"several compelling justifications for state presence in the area of abortions,\" the statutes outstripped these justifications and swept \"far beyond any areas of compelling state interest.\"  314 F.Supp. at 1222-1223.  Appellant and appellee both contest that holding.  Appellant, as has been indicated, claims an absolute right that bars any state imposition of criminal penalties in the area.  Appellee argues that the State's determination to recognize and protect prenatal life from and after conception constitutes a compelling state interest.  As noted above, we do not agree fully with either formulation.\n\nA. The appellee and certain  amici  argue that the fetus is a \"person\" within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.  In support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well known facts of fetal development.  If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, \n\n for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment.  The appellant conceded as much on reargument. [ Footnote 51 ] On the other hand, the appellee conceded on reargument [ Footnote 52 ] that no case could be cited that holds that a fetus is a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Constitution does not define \"person\" in so many words.  Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains three references to \"person.\"  The first, in defining \"citizens,\" speaks of \"persons born or naturalized in the United States.\"  The word also appears both in the Due Process Clause and in the Equal Protection Clause.  \"Person\" is used in other places in the Constitution:  in the listing of qualifications for Representatives and Senators, Art. I, § 2, cl. 2, and § 3, cl. 3; in the Apportionment Clause, Art. I, § 2, cl. 3; [ Footnote 53 ] in the Migration and Importation provision, Art. I, § 9, cl. 1; in the Emolument Clause, Art. I, § 9, cl. 8; in the Electors provisions, Art. II, § 1, cl. 2, and the superseded cl. 3; in the provision outlining qualifications for the office of President, Art. II, § 1, cl. 5; in the Extradition provisions, Art. IV, § 2, cl. 2, and the superseded Fugitive Slave Clause 3; and in the Fifth, Twelfth, and Twenty-second Amendments, as well as in §§ 2 and 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  But in nearly all these instances, the use of the word is such that it has application only post-natally.  None indicates, with any assurance, that it has any possible pre-natal application. [ Footnote 54 ] \n\n\n\nAll this, together with our observation,  supra,  that, throughout the major portion of the 19th century, prevailing legal abortion practices were far freer than they are today, persuades us that the word \"person,\" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn. [ Footnote 55 ]  This is in accord with the results reached in those few cases where the issue has been squarely presented.   McGarvey v. Magee-Womens Hospital,  340 F.Supp. 751 (WD Pa.1972);  Byrn v. New York City Health & Hospitals Corp.,  31 N.Y.2d 194, 286 N.E.2d 887 (1972),  appeal docketed,  No. 72-434;  Abele v. Markle,  351 F.Supp. 224 (Conn.1972),  appeal docketed,  No. 72-730.   Cf. Cheaney v. State,  ___ Ind. at   ___, 285 N.E.2d at 270;  Montana v. Rogers,  278 F.2d 68, 72 (CA7 1960),  aff'd sub nom.

Indeed, our decision in  United States v. Vuitch, 402 U. S. 62  (1971), inferentially is to the same effect, for we there would not have indulged in statutory interpretation favorable to abortion in specified circumstances if the necessary consequence was the termination of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection.\nThis conclusion, however, does not of itself fully answer the contentions raised by Texas, and we pass on to other considerations.\nB. The pregnant woman cannot be isolated in her privacy.  She carries an embryo and, later, a fetus, if one accepts the medical definitions of the developing young in the human uterus.    See  Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 478-479, 547 (24th ed.1965).  The situation therefore is inherently different from marital intimacy, or bedroom possession of obscene material, or marriage, or procreation, or education, with which Eisenstadt and Griswold, Stanley, Loving, Skinner, and Pierce and Meyer were respectively concerned.  As we have intimated above, it is reasonable and appropriate for a State to decide that, at some point in time another interest, that of health of the mother or that of potential human life, becomes significantly involved.  The woman's privacy is no longer sole and any right of privacy she possesses must be measured accordingly.\n\nTexas urges that, apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, life begins at conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that, therefore, the State has a compelling interest in protecting that life from and after conception.  We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins.  When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer. \n\n\n\nIt should be sufficient to note briefly the wide divergence of thinking on this most sensitive and difficult question.  There has always been strong support for the view that life does not begin until live' birth.  This was the belief of the Stoics. [ Footnote 56 ]  It appears to be the predominant, though not the unanimous, attitude of the Jewish faith. [ Footnote 57 ]  It may be taken to represent also the position of a large segment of the Protestant community, insofar as that can be ascertained; organized groups that have taken a formal position on the abortion issue have generally regarded abortion as a matter for the conscience of the individual and her family. [ Footnote 58 ]  As we have noted, the common law found greater significance in quickening.  Physician and their scientific colleagues have regarded that event with less interest and have tended to focus either upon conception, upon live birth, or upon the interim point at which the fetus becomes \"viable,\" that is, potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid. [ Footnote 59 ]  Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks. [ Footnote 60 ]  The Aristotelian theory of \"mediate animation,\" that held sway throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance in Europe, continued to be official Roman Catholic dogma until the 19th century, despite opposition to this \"ensoulment\" theory from those in the Church who would recognize the existence of life from \n\n the moment of conception. [ Footnote 61 ]  The latter is now, of course, the official belief of the Catholic Church.  As one brief  amicus  discloses, this is a view strongly held by many non-Catholics as well, and by many physicians.  Substantial problems for precise definition of this view are posed, however, by new embryological data that purport to indicate that conception is a \"process\" over time, rather than an event, and by new medical techniques such as menstrual extraction, the \"morning-after\" pill, implantation of embryos, artificial insemination, and even artificial wombs. [ Footnote 62 ]\n\nIn areas other than criminal abortion, the law has been reluctant to endorse any theory that life, as we recognize it, begins before live birth, or to accord legal rights to the unborn except in narrowly defined situations and except when the rights are contingent upon live birth.  For example, the traditional rule of tort law denied recovery for prenatal injuries even though the child was born alive. [ Footnote 63 ]  That rule has been changed in almost every jurisdiction.  In most States, recovery is said to be permitted only if the fetus was viable, or at least quick, when the injuries were sustained, though few \n\n courts have squarely so held. [ Footnote 64 ]  In a recent development, generally opposed by the commentators, some States permit the parents of a stillborn child to maintain an action for wrongful death because of prenatal injuries. [ Footnote 65 ]  Such an action, however, would appear to be one to vindicate the parents' interest and is thus consistent with the view that the fetus, at most, represents only the potentiality of life.  Similarly, unborn children have been recognized as acquiring rights or interests by way of inheritance or other devolution of property, and have been represented by guardians  ad litem.  [ Footnote 66 ]  Perfection of the interests involved, again, has generally been contingent upon live birth.  In short, the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense.\n X \n\nIn view of all this, we do not agree that, by adopting one theory of life, Texas may override the rights of the pregnant woman that are at stake.  We repeat, however, that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman, whether she be a resident of the State or a nonresident who seeks medical consultation and treatment there, and that it has still  another  important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.  These interests are separate and distinct.  Each grows in substantiality as the woman approaches \n\n term and, at a point during pregnancy, each becomes \"compelling.\"\nWith respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in the health of the mother, the \"compelling\" point, in the light of present medical knowledge, is at approximately the end of the first trimester.  This is so because of the now-established medical fact, referred to above at   410 U. S. 149 , that, until the end of the first trimester mortality in abortion may be less than mortality in normal childbirth.  It follows that, from and after this point, a State may regulate the abortion procedure to the extent that the regulation reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health.  Examples of permissible state regulation in this area are requirements as to the qualifications of the person who is to perform the abortion; as to the licensure of that person; as to the facility in which the procedure is to be performed, that is, whether it must be a hospital or may be a clinic or some other place of less-than-hospital status; as to the licensing of the facility; and the like.\nThis means, on the other hand, that, for the period of pregnancy prior to this \"compelling\" point, the attending physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the State, that, in his medical judgment, the patient's pregnancy should be terminated.  If that decision is reached, the judgment may be effectuated by an abortion free of interference by the State.\n\nWith respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in potential life, the \"compelling\" point is at viability.  This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb.  State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications.  If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion \n\n during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.\nMeasured against these standards, Art. 1196 of the Texas Penal Code, in restricting legal abortions to those \"procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother,\" sweeps too broadly.  The statute makes no distinction between abortions performed early in pregnancy and those performed later, and it limits to a single reason, \"saving\" the mother's life, the legal justification for the procedure.  The statute, therefore, cannot survive the constitutional attack made upon it here.\nThis conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider the additional challenge to the Texas statute asserted on grounds of vagueness.   See United States v. Vuitch,  402 U.S. at 67 -72.\n XI \nTo summarize and to repeat:\n1. A state criminal abortion statute of the current Texas type, that excepts from criminality only a lifesaving procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests involved, is violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.\n(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.\n\n(c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life \n\n may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\n2. The State may define the term \"physician,\" as it has been employed in the preceding paragraphs of this Part XI of this opinion, to mean only a physician currently licensed by the State, and may proscribe any abortion by a person who is not a physician as so defined.\nIn  Doe v. Bolton, post,  p.   410 U. S. 179 , procedural requirements contained in one of the modern abortion statutes are considered.  That opinion and this one, of course, are to be read together. [ Footnote 67 ]\n\nThis holding, we feel, is consistent with the relative weights of the respective interests involved, with the lessons and examples of medical and legal history, with the lenity of the common law, and with the demands of the profound problems of the present day.  The decision leaves the State free to place increasing restrictions on abortion as the period of pregnancy lengthens, so long as those restrictions are tailored to the recognized state interests.  The decision vindicates the right of the physician to administer medical treatment according to his professional judgment up to the points where important \n\n state interests provide compelling justifications for intervention.  Up to those points, the abortion decision in all its aspects is inherently, and primarily, a medical decision, and basic responsibility for it must rest with the physician.  If an individual practitioner abuses the privilege of exercising proper medical judgment, the usual remedies, judicial and intra-professional, are available.\n XII \nOur conclusion that Art. 1196 is unconstitutional means, of course, that the Texas abortion statutes, as a unit, must fall.  The exception of Art. 1196 cannot be struck down separately, for then the State would be left with a statute proscribing all abortion procedures no matter how medically urgent the case.\nAlthough the District Court granted appellant Roe declaratory relief, it stopped short of issuing an injunction against enforcement of the Texas statutes.  The Court has recognized that different considerations enter into a federal court's decision as to declaratory relief, on the one hand, and injunctive relief, on the other.   Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U. S. 241 ,   389 U. S. 252 -255 (1967);  Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479  (1965).  We are not dealing with a statute that, on its face, appears to abridge free expression, an area of particular concern under  Dombrowski  and refined in  Younger v. Harris,  401 U.S. at 50 .\nWe find it unnecessary to decide whether the District Court erred in withholding injunctive relief, for we assume the Texas prosecutorial authorities will give full credence to this decision that the present criminal abortion statutes of that State are unconstitutional.\n\nThe judgment of the District Court as to intervenor Hallford is reversed, and Dr. Hallford's complaint in intervention is dismissed.  In all other respects, the judgment \n\n of the District Court is affirmed.  Costs are allowed to the appellee.\n It is so ordered. \n[ Footnote 1 ]\n\"Article 1191.

By 'abortion' is meant that the life of the fetus or embryo shall be destroyed in the woman's womb or that a premature birth thereof be caused.\"\n\"Art. 1192.

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals disposed of that suggestion peremptorily, saying only,\n\"It is also insisted in the motion in arrest of judgment that the statute is unconstitutional and void in that it does not sufficiently define or describe the offense of abortion.  We do not concur in respect to this question.\"\n Jackson v. State,  55 Tex.Cr.R. 79, 89, 115 S.W. 262, 268 (1908).  The same court recently has held again that the State's abortion statutes are not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.   Thompson v. State  (Ct.Crim.App. Tex.1971),  appeal docketed,  No. 71-1200.  The court held that \"the State of Texas has a compelling interest to protect fetal life\"; that Art. 1191 \"is designed to protect fetal life\"; that the Texas homicide statutes, particularly Art. 1205 of the Penal Code, are intended to protect a person \"in existence by actual birth,\" and thereby implicitly recognize other human life that is not \"in existence by actual birth\"; that the definition of human life is for the legislature and not the courts; that Art. 1196 \"is more definite than the District of Columbia statute upheld in  [  402 U. S.  ] Vuitch \" (402 U.S. 62); and that the Texas statute \"is not vague and indefinite or overbroad.\"  A physician's abortion conviction was affirmed.\nIn  Thompson,  n. 2, the court observed that any issue as to the burden of proof under the exemption of Art. 1196 \"is not before us.\"   But see Veevers v. State,  172 Tex.Cr.R. 162, 168-169, 354 S.W.2d 161, 166-167 (1962).   Cf. United States v. Vuitch, 402 U. S. 62 ,   402 U.

See  App. 77.\n[ Footnote 7 ]\nWe need not consider what different result, if any, would follow if Dr. Hallford's intervention were on behalf of a class.  His complaint in intervention does not purport to assert a class suit, and makes no reference to any class apart from an allegation that he \"and others similarly situated\" must necessarily guess at the meaning of Art. 1196.  His application for leave to intervene goes somewhat further, for it asserts that plaintiff Roe does not adequately protect the interest of the doctor \"and the class of people who are physicians . . . [and] the class of people who are . . . patients. . . .\"  The leave application, however, is not the complaint.  Despite the District Court's statement to the contrary, 314 F.Supp. at 1225, we fail to perceive the essentials of a class suit in the Hallford complaint.\n[ Footnote 8 ]\nA.

See, for example,  Aristotle, Hist.Anim. 7.3.583b; Gen.Anim. 2.3.736, 2.5.741; Hippocrates, Lib. de Nat.Puer., No. 10.  Aristotle's thinking derived from his three-stage theory of life:  vegetable, animal, rational.  The vegetable stage was reached at conception, the animal at \"animation,\" and the rational soon after live birth.  This theory, together with the 40/80 day view, came to be accepted by early Christian thinkers.\nThe theological debate was reflected in the writings of St. Augustine, who made a distinction between  embryo inanimatus,  not yet endowed with a soul, and  embryo animatus.   He may have drawn upon Exodus 21:22.  At one point, however, he expressed the view that human powers cannot determine the point during fetal development at which the critical change occurs.   See  Augustine, De Origine Animae 4.4 (Pub.Law 44.527).   See also  W. Reany, The Creation of the Human Soul, c. 2 and 83-86 (1932); Huser, The Crime of Abortion in Canon Law 15 (Catholic Univ. of America, Canon Law Studies No. 162, Washington, D.C.1942).\nGalen, in three treatises related to embryology, accepted the thinking of Aristotle and his followers.  Quay 426-427.  Later, Augustine on abortion was incorporated by Gratian into the Decretum, published about 1140.  Decretum Magistri Gratiani 2.32.2.7 to 2.32.2.10, in 1 Corpus Juris Canonici 1122, 1123 (A. Friedburg, 2d ed. 1879).  This Decretal and the Decretals that followed were recognized as the definitive body of canon law until the new Code of 1917.\nFor discussions of the canon law treatment,  see  Means I, pp. 411-412; Noonan 20-26; Quay 426-430;  see also  J. Noonan, Contraception:  A History of Its Treatment by the Catholic Theologians and Canonists 18-29 (1965).\n[ Footnote 23 ]\nBracton took the position that abortion by blow or poison was homicide \"if the foetus be already formed and animated, and particularly if it be animated.\"  2 H. Bracton, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae 279 (T. Twiss ed. 1879), or, as a later translation puts it, \"if the foetus is already formed or quickened, especially if it is quickened,\" 2 H.

The author examines the two principal precedents cited marginally by Coke, both contrary to his dictum, and traces the treatment of these and other cases by earlier commentators.  He concludes that Coke, who himself participated as an advocate in an abortion case in 1601, may have intentionally misstated the law.  The author even suggests a reason:  Coke's strong feelings against abortion, coupled with his determination to assert common law (secular) jurisdiction to assess penalties for an offense that traditionally had been an exclusively ecclesiastical or canon law crime.

Recognition was given also to the several decisions in state and federal courts which show a further trend toward liberalization of abortion laws, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy.\"\n\"Recognizing that a number of problems appeared in New York, a shorter time period for 'unlimited' abortions was advisable.  The time period was bracketed to permit the various states to insert a figure more in keeping with the different conditions that might exist among the states.  Likewise, the language limiting the place or places in which abortions may be performed was also bracketed to account for different conditions among the states.  In addition, limitations on abortions after the initial 'unlimited' period were placed in brackets so that individual states may adopt all or any of these reasons, or place further restrictions upon abortions after the initial period.\"\n\"This Act does not contain any provision relating to medical review committees or prohibitions against sanctions imposed upon medical personnel refusing to participate in abortions because of religious or other similar reasons, or the like.  Such provisions, while related, do not directly pertain to when, where, or by whom abortions may be performed; however, the Act is not drafted to exclude such a provision by a state wishing to enact the same.\"\n[ Footnote 42 ]\n See, for example, YWCA v.

Neither in Texas nor in any other State are all abortions prohibited.  Despite broad proscription, an exception always exists.  The exception contained in Art. 1196, for an abortion procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother, is typical.  But if the fetus is a person who is not to be deprived of life without due process of law, and if the mother's condition is the sole determinant, does not the Texas exception appear to be out of line with the Amendment's command?\nThere are other inconsistencies between Fourteenth Amendment status and the typical abortion statute.  It has already been pointed out,   n  49,  supra,  that, in Texas, the woman is not a principal or an accomplice with respect to an abortion upon her.  If the fetus is a person, why is the woman not a principal or an accomplice?  Further, the penalty for criminal abortion specified by Art. 1195 is significantly less than the maximum penalty for murder prescribed by Art. 1257 of the Texas Penal Code.  If the fetus is a person, may the penalties be different?\n[ Footnote 55 ]\n Cf.  the Wisconsin abortion statute, defining \"unborn child\" to mean \"a human being from the time of conception until it is born alive,\" Wis.Stat. § 940.04(6) (1969), and the new Connecticut statute, Pub.Act No. 1 (May 1972 special session), declaring it to be the public policy of the State and the legislative intent \"to protect and preserve human life from the moment of conception.\"\n[ Footnote 56 ]\nEdelstein 16.\n[ Footnote 57 ]\nLader 97-99; D.

They are premised on different facts and different local conditions, but a common legal question justifies their consideration together in this consolidated opinion. [ Footnote 1 ]  \n\n\n\nIn each of the cases, minors of the Negro race, through their legal representatives, seek the aid of the courts in obtaining admission to the public schools of their community on a nonsegregated basis.  In each instance, \n\n they had been denied admission to schools attended by white children under laws requiring or permitting segregation according to race.  This segregation was alleged to deprive the plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.  In each of the cases other than the Delaware case, a three-judge federal district court denied relief to the plaintiffs on the so-called \"separate but equal\" doctrine announced by this Court in  Plessy v. Fergson, 163 U. S. 537 .  Under that doctrine, equality of treatment is accorded when the races are provided substantially equal facilities, even though these facilities be separate.  In the Delaware case, the Supreme Court of Delaware adhered to that doctrine, but ordered that the plaintiffs be admitted to the white schools because of their superiority to the Negro schools.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that segregated public schools are not \"equal\" and cannot be made \"equal,\" and that hence they are deprived of the equal protection of the laws.  Because of the obvious importance of the question presented, the Court took jurisdiction. [ Footnote 2 ]  Argument was heard in the 1952 Term, and reargument was heard this Term on certain questions propounded by the Court. [ Footnote 3 ] \n\n\nReargument was largely devoted to the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868.  It covered exhaustively consideration of the Amendment in Congress, ratification by the states, then-existing practices in racial segregation, and the views of proponents and opponents of the Amendment.  This discussion and our own investigation convince us that, although these sources cast some light, it is not enough to resolve the problem with which we are faced.  At best, they are inconclusive.  The most avid proponents of the post-War Amendments undoubtedly intended them to remove all legal distinctions among \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States.\"  Their opponents, just as certainly, were antagonistic to both the letter and the spirit of the Amendments and wished them to have the most limited effect.  What others in Congress and the state legislatures had in mind cannot be determined with any degree of certainty.\n\nAn additional reason for the inconclusive nature of the Amendment's history with respect to segregated schools is the status of public education at that time. [ Footnote 4 ]  In the South, the movement toward free common schools, supported \n\n by general taxation, had not yet taken hold.  Education of white children was largely in the hands of private groups.  Education of Negroes was almost nonexistent, and practically all of the race were illiterate.  In fact, any education of Negroes was forbidden by law in some states.  Today, in contrast, many Negroes have achieved outstanding success in the arts and sciences, as well as in the business and professional world.  It is true that public school education at the time of the Amendment had advanced further in the North, but the effect of the Amendment on Northern States was generally ignored in the congressional debates.  Even in the North, the conditions of public education did not approximate those existing today.  The curriculum was usually rudimentary; ungraded schools were common in rural areas; the school term was but three months a year in many states, and compulsory school attendance was virtually unknown.  As a consequence, it is not surprising that there should be so little in the history of the Fourteenth Amendment relating to its intended effect on public education.\n\nIn the first cases in this Court construing the Fourteenth Amendment, decided shortly after its adoption, the Court interpreted it as proscribing all state-imposed discriminations against the Negro race. [ Footnote 5 ]  The doctrine of \n\n \"separate but equal\" did not make its appearance in this Court until 1896 in the case of  Plessy v. Ferguson, supra,  involving not education but transportation. [ Footnote 6 ]  American courts have since labored with the doctrine for over half a century.  In this Court, there have been six cases involving the \"separate but equal\" doctrine in the field of public education. [ Footnote 7 ]  In  Cumming v. County Board of Education, 175 U. S. 528 , and  Gong Lum v. Rice, 275 U. S. 78 , the validity of the doctrine itself was not challenged. [ Footnote 8 ]  In more recent cases, all on the graduate school \n\n level, inequality was found in that specific benefits enjoyed by white students were denied to Negro students of the same educational qualifications.   Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U. S. 337 ;  Sipuel v. Oklahoma, 332 U. S. 631 ;  Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629 ;  McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U. S. 637 .  In none of these cases was it necessary to reexamine the doctrine to grant relief to the Negro plaintiff.  And in  Sweatt v. Painter, supra,  the Court expressly reserved decision on the question whether  Plessy v. Ferguson  should be held inapplicable to public education.\nIn the instant cases, that question is directly presented.  Here, unlike  Sweatt v. Painter,  there are findings below that the Negro and white schools involved have been equalized, or are being equalized, with respect to buildings, curricula, qualifications and salaries of teachers, and other \"tangible\" factors. [ Footnote 9 ]  Our decision, therefore, cannot turn on merely a comparison of these tangible factors in the Negro and white schools involved in each of the cases.  We must look instead to the effect of segregation itself on public education.\n\nIn approaching this problem, we cannot turn the clock back to 1868, when the Amendment was adopted, or even to 1896, when  Plessy v. Ferguson  was written.  We must consider public education in the light of its full development and its present place in American life throughout \n\n the Nation.  Only in this way can it be determined if segregation in public schools deprives these plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws.\nToday, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.  Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society.  It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces.  It is the very foundation of good citizenship.  Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment.  In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education.  Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.\nWe come then to the question presented:  does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other \"tangible\" factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities?  We believe that it does.\n\nIn  Sweatt v. Painter, supra,  in finding that a segregated law school for Negroes could not provide them equal educational opportunities, this Court relied in large part on \"those qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for greatness in a law school.\"  In  McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, supra,  the Court, in requiring that a Negro admitted to a white graduate school be treated like all other students, again resorted to intangible considerations:  \". . . his ability to study, to engage in discussions and exchange views with other students, and, in general, to learn his profession.\"  \n\n Such considerations apply with added force to children in grade and high schools.  To separate them from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.  The effect of this separation on their educational opportunities was well stated by a finding in the Kansas case by a court which nevertheless felt compelled to rule against the Negro plaintiffs:\n\"Segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children.  The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law, for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the negro group.  A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn.  Segregation with the sanction of law, therefore, has a tendency to [retard] the educational and mental development of negro children and to deprive them of some of the benefits they would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school system. [ Footnote 10 ]\"\n\nWhatever may have been the extent of psychological knowledge at the time of  Plessy v. Ferguson,  this finding is amply supported by modern authority. [ Footnote 11 ]  Any language \n\n in  Plessy v. Ferguson  contrary to this finding is rejected.\nWe conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" has no place.  Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.  Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  This disposition makes unnecessary any discussion whether such segregation also violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. [ Footnote 12 ]\n\nBecause these are class actions, because of the wide applicability of this decision, and because of the great variety of local conditions, the formulation of decrees in these cases presents problems of considerable complexity.  On reargument, the consideration of appropriate relief was necessarily subordinated to the primary question -- the constitutionality of segregation in public education.  We have now announced that such segregation is a denial of the equal protection of the laws.  In order that we may have the full assistance of the parties in formulating decrees, the cases will be restored to the docket, and the parties are requested to present further argument on Questions 4 and 5 previously propounded by the Court for the reargument this Term. [ Footnote 13 ]  The Attorney General \n\n of the United States is again invited to participate.  The Attorneys General of the states requiring or permitting segregation in public education will also be permitted to appear as  amici curiae  upon request to do so by September 15, 1954, and submission of briefs by October 1, 1954.

Board of Education,  the plaintiffs are Negro children of elementary school age residing in Topeka.  They brought this action in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas to enjoin enforcement of a Kansas statute which permits, but does not require, cities of more than 15,000 population to maintain separate school facilities for Negro and white students.  Kan.Gen.Stat. § 72-1724 (1949).  Pursuant to that authority, the Topeka Board of Education elected to establish segregated elementary schools.  Other public schools in the community, however, are operated on a nonsegregated basis.  The three-judge District Court, convened under 28 U. S. Ct. §§ 2281 and 2284, found that segregation in public education has a detrimental effect upon Negro children, but denied relief on the ground that the Negro and white schools were substantially equal with respect to buildings, transportation, curricula, and educational qualifications of teachers.  98 F.Supp. 797.  The case is here on direct appeal under 28 U. S. Ct. § 1253.\nIn the South Carolina case,  Briggs v. Elliott,  the plaintiffs are Negro children of both elementary and high school age residing in Clarendon County.  They brought this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina to enjoin enforcement of provisions in the state constitution and statutory code which require the segregation of Negroes and whites in public schools. S. Ct. Const., Art. XI, § 7; S. Ct. Code § 5377 (1942).  The three-judge District Court, convened under 28 U. S. Ct. §§ 2281 and 2284, denied the requested relief.  The court found that the Negro schools were inferior to the white schools, and ordered the defendants to begin immediately to equalize the facilities.  But the court sustained the validity of the contested provisions and denied the plaintiffs admission to the white schools during the equalization program.  98 F.Supp. 529.  This Court vacated the District Court's judgment and remanded the case for the purpose of obtaining the court's views on a report filed by the defendants concerning the progress made in the equalization program.   342 U. S. 350 .  On remand, the District Court found that substantial equality had been achieved except for buildings and that the defendants were proceeding to rectify this inequality as well.  103 F.Supp. 920.  The case is again here on direct appeal under 28 U. S. Ct. § 1253.\nIn the Virginia case,  Davis v. County School Board,  the plaintiffs are Negro children of high school age residing in Prince Edward County.  They brought this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to enjoin enforcement of provisions in the state constitution and statutory code which require the segregation of Negroes and whites in public schools.  Va.Const., § 140; Va.Code § 22-221 (1950).  The three-judge District Court, convened under 28 U. S. Ct. §§ 2281 and 2284, denied the requested relief.  The court found the Negro school inferior in physical plant, curricula, and transportation, and ordered the defendants forthwith to provide substantially equal curricula and transportation and to \"proceed with all reasonable diligence and dispatch to remove\" the inequality in physical plant.  But, as in the South Carolina case, the court sustained the validity of the contested provisions and denied the plaintiffs admission to the white schools during the equalization program.  103 F.Supp. 337.  The case is here on direct appeal under 28 U. S. Ct. § 1253.\nIn the Delaware case,  Gebhart v. Belton,  the plaintiffs are Negro children of both elementary and high school age residing in New Castle County.  They brought this action in the Delaware Court of Chancery to enjoin enforcement of provisions in the state constitution and statutory code which require the segregation of Negroes and whites in public schools.  Del.Const., Art. X, § 2; Del.Rev.Code § 2631 (1935).  The Chancellor gave judgment for the plaintiffs and ordered their immediate admission to schools previously attended only by white children, on the ground that the Negro schools were inferior with respect to teacher training, pupil-teacher ratio, extracurricular activities, physical plant, and time and distance involved in travel.  87 A.2d 862.  The Chancellor also found that segregation itself results in an inferior education for Negro children ( see note 10 infra ), but did not rest his decision on that ground.   Id.  at 865.  The Chancellor's decree was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Delaware, which intimated, however, that the defendants might be able to obtain a modification of the decree after equalization of the Negro and white schools had been accomplished.  91 A.2d 137, 152.  The defendants, contending only that the Delaware courts had erred in ordering the immediate admission of the Negro plaintiffs to the white schools, applied to this Court for certiorari.  The writ was granted, 344 U.S. 891.  The plaintiffs, who were successful below, did not submit a cross-petition.\n[ Footnote 2 ]\n 344 U. S. 1 , 141, 891.\n[ Footnote 3 ]\n345 U.S. 972.  The Attorney General of the United States participated both Terms as  amicus curiae. \n[ Footnote 4 ]\nFor a general study of the development of public education prior to the Amendment,  see  Butts and Cremin, A History of Education in American Culture (1953), Pts. I, II; Cubberley, Public Education in the United States (1934 ed.), cc. II-XII.  School practices current at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment are described in Butts and Cremin,  supra,  at 269-275; Cubberley,  supra,  at 288-339, 408-431; Knight, Public Education in the South (1922), cc. VIII, IX.   See also  H. Ex.Doc. No. 315, 41st Cong., 2d Sess. (1871).  Although the demand for free public schools followed substantially the same pattern in both the North and the South, the development in the South did not begin to gain momentum until about 1850, some twenty years after that in the North.  The reasons for the somewhat slower development in the South ( e.g.,  the rural character of the South and the different regional attitudes toward state assistance) are well explained in Cubberley,  supra,  at 408-423.  In the country as a whole, but particularly in the South, the War virtually stopped all progress in public education.   Id.  at 427-428.  The low status of Negro education in all sections of the country, both before and immediately after the War, is described in Beale, A History of Freedom of Teaching in American Schools (1941), 112-132, 175-195.  Compulsory school attendance laws were not generally adopted until after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and it was not until 1918 that such laws were in force in all the states.

S. 307 -308 (1880):\n\"It ordains that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, or deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.  What is this but declaring that the law in the States shall be the same for the black as for the white; that all persons, whether colored or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the States, and, in regard to the colored race, for whose protection the amendment was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall be made against them by law because of their color?  The words of the amendment, it is true, are prohibitory, but they contain a necessary implication of a positive immunity, or right, most valuable to the colored race -- the right to exemption from unfriendly legislation against them distinctively as colored -- exemption from legal discriminations, implying inferiority in civil society, lessening the security of their enjoyment of the rights which others enjoy, and discriminations which are steps towards reducing them to the condition of a subject race.\"\n See also Virginia v.

City of Boston,  59 Mass.198, 206 (1850), upholding school segregation against attack as being violative of a state constitutional guarantee of equality.  Segregation in Boston public schools was eliminated in 1855.  Mass.Acts 1855, c. 256.  But elsewhere in the North, segregation in public education has persisted in some communities until recent years.  It is apparent that such segregation has long been a nationwide problem, not merely one of sectional concern.\n[ Footnote 7 ]\n See also Berea College v. Kentucky, 211 U. S. 45  (1908).\n[ Footnote 8 ]\nIn the  Cummin  case, Negro taxpayers sought an injunction requiring the defendant school board to discontinue the operation of a high school for white children until the board resumed operation of a high school for Negro children.  Similarly, in the  Gong Lum  case, the plaintiff, a child of Chinese descent, contended only that state authorities had misapplied the doctrine by classifying him with Negro children and requiring him to attend a Negro school.\n[ Footnote 9 ]\nIn the Kansas case, the court below found substantial equality as to all such factors.  98 F.Supp. 797, 798.  In the South Carolina case, the court below found that the defendants were proceeding \"promptly and in good faith to comply with the court's decree.\"  103 F.Supp. 920, 921.  In the Virginia case, the court below noted that the equalization program was already \"afoot and progressing\" (103 F.Supp. 337, 341); since then, we have been advised, in the Virginia Attorney General's brief on reargument, that the program has now been completed.  In the Delaware case, the court below similarly noted that the state's equalization program was well under way.  91 A.2d 137, 149.\n[ Footnote 10 ]\nA similar finding was made in the Delaware case:\n\"I conclude from the testimony that, in our Delaware society, State-imposed segregation in education itself results in the Negro children, as a class, receiving educational opportunities which are substantially inferior to those available to white children otherwise similarly situated.\"\n87 A.2d 862, 865.\n[ Footnote 11 ]\nK.B.

More specifically, we deal with the admissibility of statements obtained from an individual who is subjected to custodial police interrogation and the necessity for procedures which assure that the individual is accorded his privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution not to be compelled to incriminate himself.  \n\n\nWe dealt with certain phases of this problem recently in  Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478  (1964).  There, as in the four cases before us, law enforcement officials took the defendant into custody and interrogated him in a police station for the purpose of obtaining a confession.  The police did not effectively advise him of his right to remain silent or of his right to consult with his attorney.  Rather, they confronted him with an alleged accomplice who accused him of having perpetrated a murder.  When the defendant denied the accusation and said \"I didn't shoot Manuel, you did it,\" they handcuffed him and took him to an interrogation room.  There, while handcuffed and standing, he was questioned for four hours until he confessed.  During this interrogation, the police denied his request to speak to his attorney, and they prevented his retained attorney, who had come to the police station, from consulting with him.  At his trial, the State, over his objection, introduced the confession against him.  We held that the statements thus made were constitutionally inadmissible.\n\nThis case has been the subject of judicial interpretation and spirited legal debate since it was decided two years ago.  Both state and federal courts, in assessing its implications, have arrived at varying conclusions. [ Footnote 1 ]  A wealth of scholarly material has been written tracing its ramifications and underpinnings. [ Footnote 2 ]  Police and prosecutor \n\n have speculated on its range and desirability. [ Footnote 3 ]  We granted certiorari in these cases, 382 U.S. 924, 925, 937, in order further to explore some facets of the problems thus exposed of applying the privilege against self-incrimination to in-custody interrogation, and to give \n\n concrete constitutional guidelines for law enforcement agencies and courts to follow.\nWe start here, as we did in  Escobedo,  with the premise that our holding is not an innovation in our jurisprudence, but is an application of principles long recognized and applied in other settings.  We have undertaken a thorough reexamination of the  Escobedo  decision and the principles it announced, and we reaffirm it.  That case was but an explication of basic rights that are enshrined in our Constitution -- that \"No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,\" and that \"the accused shall . . . have the Assistance of Counsel\" -- rights which were put in jeopardy in that case through official overbearing.  These precious rights were fixed in our Constitution only after centuries of persecution and struggle.  And, in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, they were secured \"for ages to come, and . . . designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it,\"  Cohens v. Virginia,  6 Wheat. 264,   19 U. S. 387  (1821).\nOver 70 years ago, our predecessors on this Court eloquently stated:\n\n\"The maxim  nemo tenetur seipsum accusare  had its origin in a protest against the inquisitorial and manifestly unjust methods of interrogating accused persons, which [have] long obtained in the continental system, and, until the expulsion of the Stuarts from the British throne in 1688 and the erection of additional barriers for the protection of the people against the exercise of arbitrary power, [were] not uncommon even in England.  While the admissions or confessions of the prisoner, when voluntarily and freely made, have always ranked high in the scale of incriminating evidence, if an accused person be asked to explain his apparent connection with a crime under investigation, the ease with which the \n  \n questions put to him may assume an inquisitorial character, the temptation to press the witness unduly, to browbeat him if he be timid or reluctant, to push him into a corner, and to entrap him into fatal contradictions, which is so painfully evident in many of the earlier state trials, notably in those of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton and Udal, the Puritan minister, made the system so odious as to give rise to a demand for its total abolition.  The change in the English criminal procedure in that particular seems to be founded upon no statute and no judicial opinion, but upon a general and silent acquiescence of the courts in a popular demand.  But, however adopted, it has become firmly embedded in English as well as in American jurisprudence.  So deeply did the iniquities of the ancient system impress themselves upon the minds of the American colonists that the States, with one accord, made a denial of the right to question an accused person a part of their fundamental law, so that a maxim, which in England was a mere rule of evidence, became clothed in this country with the impregnability of a constitutional enactment.\"\n Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591 ,   161 U. S. 596 -597 (1896).  In stating the obligation of the judiciary to apply these constitutional rights, this Court declared in  Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349 ,   217 U. S. 373  (1910):\n\n\". . . our contemplation cannot be only of what has been, but of what may be.  Under any other rule, a constitution would indeed be as easy of application as it would be deficient in efficacy and power.  Its general principles would have little value, and be converted by precedent into impotent and lifeless formulas.  Rights declared in words might be lost in reality.  And this has been recognized.  The \n  \n meaning and vitality of the Constitution have developed against narrow and restrictive construction.\"\nThis was the spirit in which we delineated, in meaningful language, the manner in which the constitutional rights of the individual could be enforced against overzealous police practices. It was necessary in Escobedo, as here, to insure that what was proclaimed in the Constitution had not become but a \"form of words,\"  Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 385 ,   251 U. S. 392  (1920), in the hands of government officials. And it is in this spirit, consistent with our role as judges, that we adhere to the principles of Escobedo today.\n\nOur holding will be spelled out with some specificity in the pages which follow, but, briefly stated, it is this:  the prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.  By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way. [ Footnote 4 ]  As for the procedural safeguards to be employed, unless other fully effective means are devised to inform accused persons of their right of silence and to assure a continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following measures are required.  Prior to any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.  The defendant may waive effectuation of these rights, provided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.  If, however, he indicates in any manner and at any stage of the \n\n process that he wishes to consult with an attorney before speaking, there can be no questioning.  Likewise, if the individual is alone and indicates in any manner that he does not wish to be interrogated, the police may not question him.  The mere fact that he may have answered some questions or volunteered some statements on his own does not deprive him of the right to refrain from answering any further inquiries until he has consulted with an attorney and thereafter consents to be questioned.\n I \nThe constitutional issue we decide in each of these cases is the admissibility of statements obtained from a defendant questioned while in custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.  In each, the defendant was questioned by police officers, detectives, or a prosecuting attorney in a room in which he was cut off from the outside world.  In none of these cases was the defendant given a full and effective warning of his rights at the outset of the interrogation process.  In all the cases, the questioning elicited oral admissions, and in three of them, signed statements as well which were admitted at their trials.  They all thus share salient features -- incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a police-dominated atmosphere, resulting in self-incriminating statements without full warnings of constitutional rights.\n\nAn understanding of the nature and setting of this in-custody interrogation is essential to our decisions today.  The difficulty in depicting what transpires at such interrogations stems from the fact that, in this country, they have largely taken place incommunicado.  From extensive factual studies undertaken in the early 1930's, including the famous Wickersham Report to Congress by a Presidential Commission, it is clear that police violence and the \"third degree\" flourished at that time. [ Footnote 5 ]  \n\n In a series of cases decided by this Court long after these studies, the police resorted to physical brutality -- beating, hanging, whipping -- and to sustained and protracted questioning incommunicado in order to extort confessions. [ Footnote 6 ]  The Commission on Civil Rights in 1961 found much evidence to indicate that \"some policemen still resort to physical force to obtain confessions,\" 1961 Comm'n on Civil Rights Rep. Justice, pt. 5, 17.  The use of physical brutality and violence is not, unfortunately, relegated to the past or to any part of the country.  Only recently in Kings County, New York, the police brutally beat, kicked and placed lighted cigarette butts on the back of a potential witness under interrogation for the purpose of securing a statement incriminating a third party.   People v. Portelli,  15 N.Y.2d 235, 205 N.E.2d 857, 257 N.Y.S.2d 931 (1965). [ Footnote 7 ] \n\n\nThe examples given above are undoubtedly the exception now, but they are sufficiently widespread to be the object of concern.  Unless a proper limitation upon custodial interrogation is achieved -- such as these decisions will advance -- there can be no assurance that practices of this nature will be eradicated in the foreseeable future.  The conclusion of the Wickersham Commission Report, made over 30 years ago, is still pertinent:\n\"To the contention that the third degree is necessary to get the facts, the reporters aptly reply in the language of the present Lord Chancellor of England (Lord Sankey):\"\n\"It is not admissible to do a great right by doing a little wrong. . . .  It is not sufficient to do justice by obtaining a proper result by irregular or improper means.\"\n\n\"Not only does the use of the third degree involve a flagrant violation of law by the officers of the law, but it involves also the dangers of false confessions, and it tends to make police and prosecutors less zealous in the search for objective evidence.  As the New York prosecutor quoted in the report said, 'It is a short-cut, and makes the police lazy and unenterprising.'  Or, as another official quoted remarked:  'If you use your fists, you \n  \n are not so likely to use your wits.'  We agree with the conclusion expressed in the report, that\"\n\"The third degree brutalizes the police, hardens the prisoner against society, and lowers the esteem in which the administration of Justice is held by the public.\"\n\"IV National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement, Report on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement 5 (1931).\"\nAgain we stress that the modern practice of in-custody interrogation is psychologically, rather than physically, oriented.  As we have stated before,\n\"Since  Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227 , this Court has recognized that coercion can be mental as well as physical, and that the blood of the accused is not the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition.\"\n\n Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S. 199 ,   361 U. S. 206  (1960).  Interrogation still takes place in privacy.  Privacy results in secrecy, and this, in turn, results in a gap in our knowledge as to what, in fact, goes on in the interrogation rooms.  A valuable source of information about present police practices, however, may be found in various police manuals and texts which document procedures employed with success in the past, and which recommend various other effective tactics. [ Footnote 8 ]  These  \n\n texts are used by law enforcement agencies themselves as guides. [ Footnote 9 ]  It should be noted that these texts professedly present the most enlightened and effective means presently used to obtain statements through custodial interrogation.  By considering these texts and other data, it is possible to describe procedures observed and noted around the country.\nThe officers are told by the manuals that the\n\"principal psychological factor contributing to a successful interrogation is  privacy  -- being alone with the person under interrogation. [ Footnote 10 ]\"\nThe efficacy of this tactic has been explained as follows:\n\n\"If at all practicable, the interrogation should take place in the investigator's office or at least in a room of his own choice.  The subject should be deprived of every psychological advantage.  In his own home, he may be confident, indignant, or recalcitrant.  He is more keenly aware of his rights and \n  \n more reluctant to tell of his indiscretions or criminal behavior within the walls of his home.  Moreover his family and other friends are nearby, their presence lending moral support.  In his own office, the investigator possesses all the advantages.  The atmosphere suggests the invincibility of the forces of the law. [ Footnote 11 ]\"\nTo highlight the isolation and unfamiliar surroundings, the manuals instruct the police to display an air of confidence in the suspect's guilt and, from outward appearance, to maintain only an interest in confirming certain details.  The guilt of the subject is to be posited as a fact.  The interrogator should direct his comments toward the reasons why the subject committed the act, rather than court failure by asking the subject whether he did it.  Like other men, perhaps the subject has had a bad family life, had an unhappy childhood, had too much to drink, had an unrequited desire for women.  The officers are instructed to minimize the moral seriousness of the offense, [ Footnote 12 ] to cast blame on the victim or on society. [ Footnote 13 ]  These tactics are designed to put the subject in a psychological state where his story is but an elaboration of what the police purport to know already -- that he is guilty.  Explanations to the contrary are dismissed and discouraged.\n\nThe texts thus stress that the major qualities an interrogator should possess are patience and perseverance.  \n\n One writer describes the efficacy of these characteristics in this manner:\n\"In the preceding paragraphs, emphasis has been placed on kindness and stratagems.  The investigator will, however, encounter many situations where the sheer weight of his personality will be the deciding factor.  Where emotional appeals and tricks are employed to no avail, he must rely on an oppressive atmosphere of dogged persistence.  He must interrogate steadily and without relent, leaving the subject no prospect of surcease.  He must dominate his subject and overwhelm him with his inexorable will to obtain the truth.  He should interrogate for a spell of several hours, pausing only for the subject's necessities in acknowledgment of the need to avoid a charge of duress that can be technically substantiated.  In a serious case, the interrogation may continue for days, with the required intervals for food and sleep, but with no respite from the atmosphere of domination.  It is possible in this way to induce the subject to talk without resorting to duress or coercion.  The method should be used only when the guilt of the subject appears highly probable. [ Footnote 14 ]\"\nThe manuals suggest that the suspect be offered legal excuses for his actions in order to obtain an initial admission of guilt.  Where there is a suspected revenge killing, for example, the interrogator may say:\n\n\"Joe, you probably didn't go out looking for this fellow with the purpose of shooting him.  My guess is, however, that you expected something from him, and that's why you carried a gun -- for your own protection.  You knew him for what he was, no good.  Then when you met him, he probably started using foul, abusive language and he gave some indication \n  \n that he was about to pull a gun on you, and that's when you had to act to save your own life.  That's about it, isn't it, Joe? [ Footnote 15 ]\"\nHaving then obtained the admission of shooting, the interrogator is advised to refer to circumstantial evidence which negates the self-defense explanation.  This should enable him to secure the entire story.  One text notes that,\n\"Even if he fails to do so, the inconsistency between the subject's original denial of the shooting and his present admission of at least doing the shooting will serve to deprive him of a self-defense 'out' at the time of trial. [ Footnote 16 ]\"\nWhen the techniques described above prove unavailing, the texts recommend they be alternated with a show of some hostility.  One ploy often used has been termed the \"friendly-unfriendly,\" or the \"Mutt and Jeff\" act:\n\n\". . .  In this technique, two agents are employed.  Mutt, the relentless investigator, who knows the subject is guilty and is not going to waste any time.  He's sent a dozen men away for this crime, and he's going to send the subject away for the full term.  Jeff, on the other hand, is obviously a kindhearted man.  He has a family himself.  He has a brother who was involved in a little scrape like this.  He disapproves of Mutt and his tactics, and will arrange to get him off the case if the subject will cooperate.  He can't hold Mutt off for very long.  The subject would be wise to make a quick decision.  The technique is applied by having both investigators present while Mutt acts out his role.  Jeff may stand by quietly and demur at some of Mutt's tactics.  When Jeff makes his plea for cooperation, Mutt is not present in the room. [ Footnote 17 ] \"\n  \nThe interrogators sometimes are instructed to induce a confession out of trickery.  The technique here is quite effective in crimes which require identification or which run in series.  In the identification situation, the interrogator may take a break in his questioning to place the subject among a group of men in a line-up.\n\"The witness or complainant (previously coached, if necessary) studies the line-up and confidently points out the subject as the guilty party. [ Footnote 18 ]\"\nThen the questioning resumes \"as though there were now no doubt about the guilt of the subject.\"  A variation on this technique is called the \"reverse line-up\":\n\"The accused is placed in a line-up, but this time he is identified by several fictitious witnesses or victims who associated him with different offenses.  It is expected that the subject will become desperate and confess to the offense under investigation in order to escape from the false accusations. [ Footnote 19 ]\"\nThe manuals also contain instructions for police on how to handle the individual who refuses to discuss the matter entirely, or who asks for an attorney or relatives.  The examiner is to concede him the right to remain silent.\n\n\"This usually has a very undermining effect.  First of all, he is disappointed in his expectation of an unfavorable reaction on the part of the interrogator.  Secondly, a concession of this right to remain silent impresses \n  \n the subject with the apparent fairness of his interrogator. [ Footnote 20 ]\"\nAfter this psychological conditioning, however, the officer is told to point out the incriminating significance of the suspect's refusal to talk:\n\"Joe, you have a right to remain silent.  That's your privilege, and I'm the last person in the world who'll try to take it away from you.  If that's the way you want to leave this, O. K.  But let me ask you this.  Suppose you were in my shoes, and I were in yours, and you called me in to ask me about this, and I told you, 'I don't want to answer any of your questions.'  You'd think I had something to hide, and you'd probably be right in thinking that.  That's exactly what I'll have to think about you, and so will everybody else.  So let's sit here and talk this whole thing over. [ Footnote 21 ]\"\nFew will persist in their initial refusal to talk, it is said, if this monologue is employed correctly.\nIn the event that the subject wishes to speak to a relative or an attorney, the following advice is tendered:\n\n\"[T]he interrogator should respond by suggesting that the subject first tell the truth to the interrogator himself, rather than get anyone else involved in the matter.  If the request is for an attorney, the interrogator may suggest that the subject save himself or his family the expense of any such professional service, particularly if he is innocent of the offense under investigation.  The interrogator may also add, 'Joe, I'm only looking for the truth, and if you're telling the truth, that's it.  You can handle this by yourself.' [ Footnote 22 ] \"\n  \nFrom these representative samples of interrogation techniques, the setting prescribed by the manuals and observed in practice becomes clear.  In essence, it is this:  to be alone with the subject is essential to prevent distraction and to deprive him of any outside support.  The aura of confidence in his guilt undermines his will to resist.  He merely confirms the preconceived story the police seek to have him describe.  Patience and persistence, at times relentless questioning, are employed.  To obtain a confession, the interrogator must \"patiently maneuver himself or his quarry into a position from which the desired objective may be attained.\" [ Footnote 23 ]  When normal procedures fail to produce the needed result, the police may resort to deceptive stratagems such as giving false legal advice.  It is important to keep the subject off balance, for example, by trading on his insecurity about himself or his surroundings.  The police then persuade, trick, or cajole him out of exercising his constitutional rights.\n\nEven without employing brutality, the \"third degree\" or the specific stratagems described above, the very fact of custodial interrogation exacts a heavy toll on individual liberty, and trades on the weakness of individuals. [ Footnote 24 ]  \n\n This fact may be illustrated simply by referring to three confession cases decided by this Court in the Term immediately preceding our  Escobedo  decision.  In  Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293  (1963), the defendant was a 19-year-old heroin addict, described as a \"near mental defective,\"  id.  at 307 -310.  The defendant in  Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528  (1963), was a woman who confessed to the arresting officer after being importuned to \"cooperate\" in order to prevent her children from being taken by relief authorities.  This Court, as in those cases, reversed the conviction of a defendant in  Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503  (1963), whose persistent request during his interrogation was to phone his wife or attorney. [ Footnote 25 ]  In other settings, these individuals might have exercised their constitutional rights.  In the incommunicado police-dominated atmosphere, they succumbed.\n\nIn the cases before us today, given this background, we concern ourselves primarily with this interrogation atmosphere and the evils it can bring.  In No. 759,  Miranda v. Arizona,  the police arrested the defendant and took him to a special interrogation room, where they secured a confession.  In No. 760,  Vignera v. New York,  the defendant made oral admissions to the police after interrogation in the afternoon, and then signed an inculpatory statement upon being questioned by an assistant district attorney later the same evening.  In No. 761,  Westover v. United States,  the defendant was handed over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation by \n\n local authorities after they had detained and interrogated him for a lengthy period, both at night and the following morning.  After some two hours of questioning, the federal officers had obtained signed statements from the defendant.  Lastly, in No. 584,  California v. Stewart,  the local police held the defendant five days in the station and interrogated him on nine separate occasions before they secured his inculpatory statement.\nIn these cases, we might not find the defendants' statements to have been involuntary in traditional terms.  Our concern for adequate safeguards to protect precious Fifth Amendment rights is, of course, not lessened in the slightest.  In each of the cases, the defendant was thrust into an unfamiliar atmosphere and run through menacing police interrogation procedures.  The potentiality for compulsion is forcefully apparent, for example, in  Miranda,  where the indigent Mexican defendant was a seriously disturbed individual with pronounced sexual fantasies, and in  Stewart,  in which the defendant was an indigent Los Angeles Negro who had dropped out of school in the sixth grade.  To be sure, the records do not evince overt physical coercion or patent psychological ploys.  The fact remains that in none of these cases did the officers undertake to afford appropriate safeguards at the outset of the interrogation to insure that the statements were truly the product of free choice.\n\nIt is obvious that such an interrogation environment is created for no purpose other than to subjugate the individual to the will of his examiner.  This atmosphere carries its own badge of intimidation.  To be sure, this is not physical intimidation, but it is equally destructive of human dignity. [ Footnote 26 ]  The current practice of incommunicado interrogation is at odds with one of our \n\n Nation's most cherished principles -- that the individual may not be compelled to incriminate himself.  Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice.\nFrom the foregoing, we can readily perceive an intimate connection between the privilege against self-incrimination and police custodial questioning.  It is fitting to turn to history and precedent underlying the Self-Incrimination Clause to determine its applicability in this situation.\n II \n\nWe sometimes forget how long it has taken to establish the privilege against self-incrimination, the sources from which it came, and the fervor with which it was defended.  Its roots go back into ancient times. [ Footnote 27 ]  Perhaps \n\n the critical historical event shedding light on its origins and evolution was the trial of one John Lilburn, a vocal anti-Stuart Leveller, who was made to take the Star Chamber Oath in 1637.  The oath would have bound him to answer to all questions posed to him on any subject.   The Trial of John Lilburn and John Wharton,  3 How.St.Tr. 1315 (1637).  He resisted the oath and declaimed the proceedings, stating:\n\"Another fundamental right I then contended for was that no man's conscience ought to be racked by oaths imposed to answer to questions concerning himself in matters criminal, or pretended to be so.\"\nHaller & Davies, The Leveller Tracts 1647-1653, p. 454 (1944)\nOn account of the Lilburn Trial, Parliament abolished the inquisitorial Court of Star Chamber and went further in giving him generous reparation.  The lofty principles to which Lilburn had appealed during his trial gained popular acceptance in England. [ Footnote 28 ]  These sentiments worked their way over to the Colonies, and were implanted after great struggle into the Bill of Rights. [ Footnote 29 ]  Those who framed our Constitution and the Bill of Rights were ever aware of subtle encroachments on individual liberty.  They knew that\n\"illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing . . . by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure.\"\n\n Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616 ,   116 U. S. 635  (1886).  The privilege was elevated to constitutional status, and has always been \"as broad as the mischief \n\n against which it seeks to guard.\"   Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547 ,   142 U. S. 562  (1892).  We cannot depart from this noble heritage.\nThus, we may view the historical development of the privilege as one which groped for the proper scope of governmental power over the citizen.  As a \"noble principle often transcends its origins,\" the privilege has come rightfully to be recognized in part as an individual's substantive right, a \"right to a private enclave where he may lead a private life.  That right is the hallmark of our democracy.\"   United States v. Grunewald,  233 F.2d 556, 579, 581-582 (Frank, J., dissenting),  rev'd, 363 U. S. 353  U.S. 391 (1957).  We have recently noted that the privilege against self-incrimination -- the essential mainstay of our adversary system -- is founded on a complex of values,  Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U. S. 52 ,   378 U. S. 55 -57, n. 5 (1964);  Tehan v. Shott, 382 U. S. 406 ,   382 U. S. 414 -415, n. 12 (1966).  All these policies point to one overriding thought:  the constitutional foundation underlying the privilege is the respect a government -- state or federal -- must accord to the dignity and integrity of its citizens.  To maintain a \"fair state-individual balance,\" to require the government \"to shoulder the entire load,\" 8 Wigmore, Evidence 317 (McNaughton rev.1961), to respect the inviolability of the human personality, our accusatory system of criminal justice demands that the government seeking to punish an individual produce the evidence against him by its own independent labors, rather than by the cruel, simple expedient of compelling it from his own mouth.   Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227 ,   309 U. S. 235 -238 (1940).  In sum, the privilege is fulfilled only when the person is guaranteed the right \"to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will.\"   Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 ,   378 U. S. 8  (1964).\n\nThe question in these cases is whether the privilege is fully applicable during a period of custodial interrogation.  \n\n In this Court, the privilege has consistently been accorded a liberal construction.   Albertson v. SACB, 382 U. S. 70 ,   382 U. S. 81  (1965);  Hoffman v. United States, 341 U. S. 479 ,   341 U. S. 486  (1951);  Arndstein v. McCarthy, 254 U. S. 71 ,   254 U. S. 72 -73 (1920);  Counselman v. Hitchock, 142 U. S. 547 ,   142 U. S. 562  (1892).  We are satisfied that all the principles embodied in the privilege apply to informal compulsion exerted by law enforcement officers during in-custody questioning.  An individual swept from familiar surroundings into police custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces, and subjected to the techniques of persuasion described above cannot be otherwise than under compulsion to speak.  As a practical matter, the compulsion to speak in the isolated setting of the police station may well be greater than in courts or other official investigations, where there are often impartial observers to guard against intimidation or trickery. [ Footnote 30 ]\nThis question, in fact, could have been taken as settled in federal courts almost 70 years ago, when, in  Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532 ,   168 U. S. 542  (1897), this Court held:\n\"In criminal trials, in the courts of the United States, wherever a question arises whether a confession is incompetent because not voluntary, the issue is controlled by that portion of the Fifth Amendment . . . commanding that no person 'shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.'\"\nIn  Bram,  the Court reviewed the British and American history and case law and set down the Fifth Amendment standard for compulsion which we implement today:\n\n\"Much of the confusion which has resulted from the effort to deduce from the adjudged cases what \n  \n would be a sufficient quantum of proof to show that a confession was or was not voluntary, has arisen from a misconception of the subject to which the proof must address itself.  The rule is not that, in order to render a statement admissible, the proof must be adequate to establish that the particular communications contained in a statement were voluntarily made, but it must be sufficient to establish that the making of the statement was voluntary; that is to say, that from the causes, which the law treats as legally sufficient to engender in the mind of the accused hope or fear in respect to the crime charged, the accused was not involuntarily impelled to make a statement, when, but for the improper influences, he would have remained silent. . . .\"\n168 U.S. at 549 .   And see id.  at 542 .\nThe Court has adhered to this reasoning.  In 1924, Mr. Justice Brandeis wrote for a unanimous Court in reversing a conviction resting on a compelled confession,  Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1 .  He stated:\n\"In the federal courts, the requisite of voluntariness is not satisfied by establishing merely that the confession was not induced by a promise or a threat.  A confession is voluntary in law if, and only if, it was, in fact, voluntarily made.  A confession may have been given voluntarily, although it was made to police officers, while in custody, and in answer to an examination conducted by them.  But a confession obtained by compulsion must be excluded whatever may have been the character of the compulsion, and whether the compulsion was applied in a judicial proceeding or otherwise.   Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532 .\"\n\n266 U.S. at 14 -15.  In addition to the expansive historical development of the privilege and the sound policies which have nurtured \n\n its evolution, judicial precedent thus clearly establishes its application to incommunicado interrogation.  In fact, the Government concedes this point as well established in No. 761,  Westover v. United States,  stating:\n\"We have no doubt . . . that it is possible for a suspect's Fifth Amendment right to be violated during in-custody questioning by a law enforcement officer. [ Footnote 31 ]\"\nBecause of the adoption by Congress of Rule 5(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and this Court's effectuation of that Rule in  McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332  (1943), and  Mallory v. United States, 354 U. S. 449  (1957), we have had little occasion in the past quarter century to reach the constitutional issues in dealing with federal interrogations.  These supervisory rules, requiring production of an arrested person before a commissioner \"without unnecessary delay\" and excluding evidence obtained in default of that statutory obligation, were nonetheless responsive to the same considerations of Fifth Amendment policy that unavoidably face us now as to the States.  In  McNabb,  318 U.S. at 343 -344, and in  Mallory,  354 U.S. at 455 -456, we recognized both the dangers of interrogation and the appropriateness of prophylaxis stemming from the very fact of interrogation itself. [ Footnote 32 ]\n\nOur decision in  Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1  (1964), necessitates an examination of the scope of the privilege in state cases as well.  In  Malloy,  we squarely held the \n\n privilege applicable to the States, and held that the substantive standards underlying the privilege applied with full force to state court proceedings.  There, as in  Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U. S. 52  (1964), and  Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609  (1965), we applied the existing Fifth Amendment standards to the case before us.  Aside from the holding itself, the reasoning in  Malloy  made clear what had already become apparent -- that the substantive and procedural safeguards surrounding admissibility of confessions in state cases had become exceedingly exacting, reflecting all the policies embedded in the privilege, 378 U.S. at 7 -8. [ Footnote 33 ]  The voluntariness doctrine in the state cases, as  Malloy  indicates, encompasses all interrogation practices which are likely to exert such pressure upon an individual as to disable him from \n\n making a free and rational choice. [ Footnote 34 ]  The implications of this proposition were elaborated in our decision in  Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 , decided one week after  Malloy  applied the privilege to the States.\nOur holding there stressed the fact that the police had not advised the defendant of his constitutional privilege to remain silent at the outset of the interrogation, and we drew attention to that fact at several points in the decision, 378 U.S. at 483 ,   378 U. S. 485 ,   378 U. S. 491 .  This was no isolated factor, but an essential ingredient in our decision.  The entire thrust of police interrogation there, as in all the cases today, was to put the defendant in such an emotional state as to impair his capacity for rational judgment.  The abdication of the constitutional privilege -- the choice on his part to speak to the police -- was not made knowingly or competently because of the failure to apprise him of his rights; the compelling atmosphere of the in-custody interrogation, and not an independent decision on his part, caused the defendant to speak.\n\nA different phase of the  Escobedo  decision was significant in its attention to the absence of counsel during the questioning.  There, as in the cases today, we sought a protective device to dispel the compelling atmosphere of the interrogation.  In  Escobedo,  however, the police did not relieve the defendant of the anxieties which they had created in the interrogation rooms.  Rather, they denied his request for the assistance of counsel, 378 U.S. at 481 ,   378 U. S. 488 ,   378 U. S. 491 . [ Footnote 35 ]  This heightened his dilemma, and \n\n made his later statements the product of this compulsion.   Cf. Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 ,   373 U. S. 514  (1963).  The denial of the defendant's request for his attorney thus undermined his ability to exercise the privilege -- to remain silent if he chose or to speak without any intimidation, blatant or subtle.  The presence of counsel, in all the cases before us today, would he the adequate protective device necessary to make the process of police interrogation conform to the dictates of the privilege.  His presence would insure that statements made in the government-established atmosphere are not the product of compulsion.\nIt was in this manner that  Escobedo  explicated another facet of the pretrial privilege, noted in many of the Court's prior decisions:  the protection of rights at trial. [ Footnote 36 ]  That counsel is present when statements are taken from an individual during interrogation obviously enhances the integrity of the factfinding processes in court.  The presence of an attorney, and the warnings delivered to the individual, enable the defendant under otherwise compelling circumstances to tell his story without fear, effectively, and in a way that eliminates the evils in the interrogation process.  Without the protections flowing from adequate warnings and the rights of counsel,\n\"all the careful safeguards erected around the giving of testimony, whether by an accused or any other witness, would become empty formalities in a procedure where the most compelling possible evidence of guilt, a confession, would have already been obtained at the unsupervised pleasure of the police.\"\n\n Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 ,   367 U. S. 685  (1961) (HARLAN, J., dissenting).   Cf. Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400  (1965). \n\n\n III \nToday, then, there can be no doubt that the Fifth Amendment privilege is available outside of criminal court proceedings, and serves to protect persons in all settings in which their freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from being compelled to incriminate themselves.  We have concluded that, without proper safeguards, the process of in-custody interrogation of persons suspected or accused of crime contains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual's will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.  In order to combat these pressures and to permit a full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination, the accused must be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights, and the exercise of those rights must be fully honored.\nIt is impossible for us to foresee the potential alternatives for protecting the privilege which might be devised by Congress or the States in the exercise of their creative rulemaking capacities.  Therefore, we cannot say that the Constitution necessarily requires adherence to any particular solution for the inherent compulsions of the interrogation process as it is presently conducted.  Our decision in no way creates a constitutional straitjacket which will handicap sound efforts at reform, nor is it intended to have this effect.  We encourage Congress and the States to continue their laudable search for increasingly effective ways of protecting the rights of the individual while promoting efficient enforcement of our criminal laws.  However, unless we are shown other procedures which are at least as effective in apprising accused persons of their right of silence and in assuring a continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following safeguards must be observed.\n\nAt the outset, if a person in custody is to be subjected to interrogation, he must first be informed in clear and \n\n unequivocal terms that he has the right to remain silent.  For those unaware of the privilege, the warning is needed simply to make them aware of it -- the threshold requirement for an intelligent decision as to its exercise.  More important, such a warning is an absolute prerequisite in overcoming the inherent pressures of the interrogation atmosphere.  It is not just the subnormal or woefully ignorant who succumb to an interrogator's imprecations, whether implied or expressly stated, that the interrogation will continue until a confession is obtained or that silence in the face of accusation is itself damning, and will bode ill when presented to a jury. [ Footnote 37 ]  Further, the warning will show the individual that his interrogators are prepared to recognize his privilege should he choose to exercise it.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment privilege is so fundamental to our system of constitutional rule, and the expedient of giving an adequate warning as to the availability of the privilege so simple, we will not pause to inquire in individual cases whether the defendant was aware of his rights without a warning being given.  Assessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed, based on information \n\n as to his age, education, intelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be more than speculation; [ Footnote 38 ] a warning is a clear-cut fact.  More important, whatever the background of the person interrogated, a warning at the time of the interrogation is indispensable to overcome its pressures and to insure that the individual knows he is free to exercise the privilege at that point in time.\nThe warning of the right to remain silent must be accompanied by the explanation that anything said can and will be used against the individual in court.  This warning is needed in order to make him aware not only of the privilege, but also of the consequences of forgoing it.  It is only through an awareness of these consequences that there can be any assurance of real understanding and intelligent exercise of the privilege.  Moreover, this warning may serve to make the individual more acutely aware that he is faced with a phase of the adversary system -- that he is not in the presence of persons acting solely in his interest.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of his privilege by his interrogators.  Therefore, the right to have counsel present at the interrogation is indispensable to the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege under the system we delineate today.  Our aim is to assure that the individual's right to choose between silence and speech remains unfettered throughout the interrogation process.  A once-stated warning, delivered by those who will conduct the interrogation, cannot itself suffice to that end among those who most require knowledge of their rights.  A mere \n\n warning given by the interrogators is not alone sufficient to accomplish that end.  Prosecutors themselves claim that the admonishment of the right to remain silent, without more, \"will benefit only the recidivist and the professional.\"  Brief for the National District Attorneys Association as  amicus curiae,  p. 14.  Even preliminary advice given to the accused by his own attorney can be swiftly overcome by the secret interrogation process.   Cf. Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 ,   378 U. S. 485 , n. 5.  Thus, the need for counsel to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege comprehends not merely a right to consult with counsel prior to questioning, but also to have counsel present during any questioning if the defendant so desires.\nThe presence of counsel at the interrogation may serve several significant subsidiary functions, as well.  If the accused decides to talk to his interrogators, the assistance of counsel can mitigate the dangers of untrustworthiness.  With a lawyer present, the likelihood that the police will practice coercion is reduced, and, if coercion is nevertheless exercised, the lawyer can testify to it in court.  The presence of a lawyer can also help to guarantee that the accused gives a fully accurate statement to the police, and that the statement is rightly reported by the prosecution at trial.   See Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 ,   357 U. S. 443 -448 (1958) (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting).\n\nAn individual need not make a pre-interrogation request for a lawyer.  While such request affirmatively secures his right to have one, his failure to ask for a lawyer does not constitute a waiver.  No effective waiver of the right to counsel during interrogation can be recognized unless specifically made after the warnings we here delineate have been given.  The accused who does not know his rights and therefore does not make a request \n\n may be the person who most needs counsel.  As the California Supreme Court has aptly put it:\n\"Finally, we must recognize that the imposition of the requirement for the request would discriminate against the defendant who does not know his rights.  The defendant who does not ask for counsel is the very defendant who most needs counsel.  We cannot penalize a defendant who, not understanding his constitutional rights, does not make the formal request, and, by such failure, demonstrates his helplessness.  To require the request would be to favor the defendant whose sophistication or status had fortuitously prompted him to make it.\"\n People v. Dorado,  62 Cal.2d 338, 351, 398 P.2d 361, 369-370, 42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 177-178 (1965) (Tobriner, J.).  In  Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U. S. 506 ,   369 U. S. 513  (1962), we stated:\n\"[I]t is settled that, where the assistance of counsel is a constitutional requisite, the right to be furnished counsel does not depend on a request.\"\nThis proposition applies with equal force in the context of providing counsel to protect an accused's Fifth Amendment privilege in the face of interrogation. [ Footnote 39 ]  Although the role of counsel at trial differs from the role during interrogation, the differences are not relevant to the question whether a request is a prerequisite.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that an individual held for interrogation must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation under the system for protecting the privilege we delineate today.  As with the warnings of the right to remain silent and that anything stated can be used in evidence against him, this warning is an absolute prerequisite to interrogation.  No amount of \n\n circumstantial evidence that the person may have been aware of this right will suffice to stand in its stead.  Only through such a warning is there ascertainable assurance that the accused was aware of this right.\n\nIf an individual indicates that he wishes the assistance of counsel before any interrogation occurs, the authorities cannot rationally ignore or deny his request on the basis that the individual does not have or cannot afford a retained attorney.  The financial ability of the individual has no relationship to the scope of the rights involved here.  The privilege against self-incrimination secured by the Constitution applies to all individuals.  The need for counsel in order to protect the privilege exists for the indigent as well as the affluent.  In fact, were we to limit these constitutional rights to those who can retain an attorney, our decisions today would be of little significance.  The cases before us, as well as the vast majority of confession cases with which we have dealt in the past, involve those unable to retain counsel. [ Footnote 40 ]  While authorities are not required to relieve the accused of his poverty, they have the obligation not to take advantage of indigence in the administration of justice. [ Footnote 41 ]  Denial \n\n of counsel to the indigent at the time of interrogation while allowing an attorney to those who can afford one would be no more supportable by reason or logic than the similar situation at trial and on appeal struck down in  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335  (1963), and  Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353  (1963).\nIn order fully to apprise a person interrogated of the extent of his rights under this system, then, it is necessary to warn him not only that he has the right to consult with an attorney, but also that, if he is indigent, a lawyer will be appointed to represent him.  Without this additional warning, the admonition of the right to consult with counsel would often be understood as meaning only that he can consult with a lawyer if he has one or has the funds to obtain one.  The warning of a right to counsel would be hollow if not couched in terms that would convey to the indigent -- the person most often subjected to interrogation -- the knowledge that he too has a right to have counsel present. [ Footnote 42 ]  As with the warnings of the right to remain silent and of the general right to counsel, only by effective and express explanation to the indigent of this right can there be assurance that he was truly in a position to exercise it. [ Footnote 43 ]\n\nOnce warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure is clear.  If the individual indicates in any manner, \n\n at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. [ Footnote 44 ]  At this point, he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise.  Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody interrogation operates on the individual to overcome free choice in producing a statement after the privilege has been once invoked.  If the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.  At that time, the individual must have an opportunity to confer with the attorney and to have him present during any subsequent questioning.  If the individual cannot obtain an attorney and he indicates that he wants one before speaking to police, they must respect his decision to remain silent.\n\nThis does not mean, as some have suggested, that each police station must have a \"station house lawyer\" present at all times to advise prisoners.  It does mean, however, that, if police propose to interrogate a person, they must make known to him that he is entitled to a lawyer and that, if he cannot afford one, a lawyer will be provided for him prior to any interrogation.  If authorities conclude that they will not provide counsel during a reasonable period of time in which investigation in the field is carried out, they may refrain from doing so without violating the person's Fifth Amendment privilege so long as they do not question him during that time. \n\n\nIf the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel.   Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 ,   378 U. S. 490 , n. 14.  This Court has always set high standards of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights,  Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458  (1938), and we reassert these standards as applied to in-custody interrogation.  Since the State is responsible for establishing the isolated circumstances under which the interrogation takes place, and has the only means of making available corroborated evidence of warnings given during incommunicado interrogation, the burden is rightly on its shoulders.\nAn express statement that the individual is willing to make a statement and does not want an attorney, followed closely by a statement, could constitute a waiver.  But a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are given, or simply from the fact that a confession was, in fact, eventually obtained.  A statement we made in  Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U. S. 506 ,   369 U. S. 516  (1962), is applicable here:\n\"Presuming waiver from a silent record is impermissible.  The record must show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer.  Anything less is not waiver.\"\n\n See also Glasser v. United States, 315 U. S. 60  (1942).  Moreover, where in-custody interrogation is involved, there is no room for the contention that the privilege is waived if the individual answers some questions or gives \n\n some information on his own prior to invoking his right to remain silent when interrogated. [ Footnote 45 ]\nWhatever the testimony of the authorities as to waiver of rights by an accused, the fact of lengthy interrogation or incommunicado incarceration before a statement is made is strong evidence that the accused did not validly waive his rights.  In these circumstances, the fact that the individual eventually made a statement is consistent with the conclusion that the compelling influence of the interrogation finally forced him to do so.  It is inconsistent with any notion of a voluntary relinquishment of the privilege.  Moreover, any evidence that the accused was threatened, tricked, or cajoled into a waiver will, of course, show that the defendant did not voluntarily waive his privilege.  The requirement of warnings and waiver of rights is a fundamental with respect to the Fifth Amendment privilege, and not simply a preliminary ritual to existing methods of interrogation.\n\nThe warnings required and the waiver necessary in accordance with our opinion today are, in the absence of a fully effective equivalent, prerequisites to the admissibility of any statement made by a defendant.  No distinction can be drawn between statements which are direct confessions and statements which amount to \"admissions\" of part or all of an offense.  The privilege against self-incrimination protects the individual from being compelled to incriminate himself in any manner; it does not distinguish degrees of incrimination.  Similarly, \n\n for precisely the same reason, no distinction may be drawn between inculpatory statements and statements alleged to be merely \"exculpatory.\"  If a statement made were, in fact, truly exculpatory, it would, of course, never be used by the prosecution.  In fact, statements merely intended to be exculpatory by the defendant are often used to impeach his testimony at trial or to demonstrate untruths in the statement given under interrogation, and thus to prove guilt by implication.  These statements are incriminating in any meaningful sense of the word, and may not be used without the full warnings and effective waiver required for any other statement.  In  Escobedo  itself, the defendant fully intended his accusation of another as the slayer to be exculpatory as to himself.\nThe principles announced today deal with the protection which must be given to the privilege against self-incrimination when the individual is first subjected to police interrogation while in custody at the station or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.  It is at this point that our adversary system of criminal proceedings commences, distinguishing itself at the outset from the inquisitorial system recognized in some countries.  Under the system of warnings we delineate today, or under any other system which may be devised and found effective, the safeguards to be erected about the privilege must come into play at this point.\n\nOur decision is not intended to hamper the traditional function of police officers in investigating crime.   See Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 ,   378 U. S. 492 .  When an individual is in custody on probable cause, the police may, of course, seek out evidence in the field to be used at trial against him.  Such investigation may include inquiry of persons not under restraint.  General on-the-scene questioning as to facts surrounding a crime or other general questioning of citizens in the factfinding process is not affected by our holding.  It is an act of \n\n responsible citizenship for individuals to give whatever information they may have to aid in law enforcement.  In such situations, the compelling atmosphere inherent in the process of in-custody interrogation is not necessarily present. [ Footnote 46 ]\nIn dealing with statements obtained through interrogation, we do not purport to find all confessions inadmissible.  Confessions remain a proper element in law enforcement.  Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence.  The fundamental import of the privilege while an individual is in custody is not whether he is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit of warnings and counsel, but whether he can be interrogated.  There is no requirement that police stop a person who enters a police station and states that he wishes to confess to a crime, [ Footnote 47 ] or a person who calls the police to offer a confession or any other statement he desires to make.  Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment, and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today.\n\nTo summarize, we hold that, when an individual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning, the privilege against self-incrimination is jeopardized.  Procedural safeguards must be employed to \n\n protect the privilege, and unless other fully effective means are adopted to notify the person of his right of silence and to assure that the exercise of the right will be scrupulously honored, the following measures are required.  He must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that, if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.  Opportunity to exercise these rights must be afforded to him throughout the interrogation.  After such warnings have been given, and such opportunity afforded him, the individual may knowingly and intelligently waive these rights and agree to answer questions or make a statement.  But unless and until such warnings and waiver are demonstrated by the prosecution at trial, no evidence obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against him. [ Footnote 48 ]\n IV \nA recurrent argument made in these cases is that society's need for interrogation outweighs the privilege.  This argument is not unfamiliar to this Court.   See, e.g., Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227 ,   309 U. S. 240 -241 (1940).  The whole thrust of our foregoing discussion demonstrates that the Constitution has prescribed the rights of the individual when confronted with the power of government when it provided in the Fifth Amendment that an individual cannot be compelled to be a witness against himself.  That right cannot be abridged.  As Mr. Justice Brandeis once observed:\n\n\"Decency, security and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same \n  \n rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen.  In a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperilled if it fail to observe the law scrupulously.  Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher.  For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.  Crime is contagious.  If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.  To declare that, in the administration of the criminal law, the end justifies the means . . . would bring terrible retribution.  Against that pernicious doctrine this Court should resolutely set its face.\"\n Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 ,   277 U. S. 485  (1928) (dissenting opinion). [ Footnote 49 ]  In this connection, one of our country's distinguished jurists has pointed out:  \"The quality of a nation's civilization can be largely measured by the methods it uses in the enforcement of its criminal law.\" [ Footnote 50 ]\n\nIf the individual desires to exercise his privilege, he has the right to do so.  This is not for the authorities to decide.  An attorney may advise his client not to talk to police until he has had an opportunity to investigate the case, or he may wish to be present with his client during any police questioning.  In doing so an attorney is merely exercising the good professional judgment he has been taught.  This is not cause for considering the attorney a menace to law enforcement.  He is merely carrying out what he is sworn to do under his oath -- to protect to the extent of his ability the rights of his client.  \n\n In fulfilling this responsibility, the attorney plays a vital role in the administration of criminal justice under our Constitution.\n\nIn announcing these principles, we are not unmindful of the burdens which law enforcement officials must bear, often under trying circumstances.  We also fully recognize the obligation of all citizens to aid in enforcing the criminal laws.  This Court, while protecting individual rights, has always given ample latitude to law enforcement agencies in the legitimate exercise of their duties.  The limits we have placed on the interrogation process should not constitute an undue interference with a proper system of law enforcement.  As we have noted, our decision does not in any way preclude police from carrying out their traditional investigatory functions.  Although confessions may play an important role in some convictions, the cases before us present graphic examples of the overstatement of the \"need\" for confessions.  In each case, authorities conducted interrogations ranging up to five days in duration despite the presence, through standard investigating practices, of considerable evidence against each defendant. [ Footnote 51 ]  Further examples are chronicled in our prior cases.   See, e.g., Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 ,   373 U. S. 518 -519 (1963);  Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534 ,   365 U. S. 541  (1961);  Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401 ,402 (1945). [ Footnote 52 ] \n\n\nIt is also urged that an unfettered right to detention for interrogation should be allowed because it will often redound to the benefit of the person questioned.  When police inquiry determines that there is no reason to believe that the person has committed any crime, it is said, he will be released without need for further formal procedures.  The person who has committed no offense, however, will be better able to clear himself after warnings with counsel present than without.  It can be assumed that, in such circumstances, a lawyer would advise his client to talk freely to police in order to clear himself.\n\nCustodial interrogation, by contrast, does not necessarily afford the innocent an opportunity to clear themselves.  A serious consequence of the present practice of the interrogation alleged to be beneficial for the innocent is that many arrests \"for investigation\" subject large numbers of innocent persons to detention and interrogation.  In one of the cases before us, No. 584,  California v. Stewart,  police held four persons, who were in the defendant's house at the time of the arrest, in jail for five days until defendant confessed.  At that time, they were finally released.  Police stated that there was \"no evidence to connect them with any crime.\"  Available statistics on the extent of this practice where it is condoned indicate that these four are far from alone in being subjected to arrest, prolonged detention, and interrogation without the requisite probable cause. [ Footnote 53 ] \n\n\n\nOver the years, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has compiled an exemplary record of effective law enforcement while advising any suspect or arrested person, at the outset of an interview, that he is not required to make a statement, that any statement may be used against him in court, that the individual may obtain the services of an attorney of his own choice, and, more recently, that he has a right to free counsel if he is unable to pay. [ Footnote 54 ]  A letter received from the Solicitor General in response to a question from the Bench makes it clear that the present pattern of warnings and respect for the \n\n rights of the individual followed as a practice by the FBI is consistent with the procedure which we delineate today.  It states:\n\"At the oral argument of the above cause, Mr. Justice Fortas asked whether I could provide certain information as to the practices followed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  I have directed these questions to the attention of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and am submitting herewith a statement of the questions and of the answers which we have received.\"\n\"   (1) When an individual is interviewed by agents of the Bureau, what warning is given to him?\"\n\"   The standard warning long given by Special Agents of the FBI to both suspects and persons under arrest is that the person has a right to say nothing and a right to counsel, and that any statement he does make may be used against him in court.  Examples of this warning are to be found in the  Westover  case at 342 F.2d 684 (1965), and  Jackson v. U.S.,  337 F.2d 136 (1964),  cert. den.,  380 U.S. 935.\"\n\n\"   After passage of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, which provides free counsel for Federal defendants unable to pay, we added to our instructions to Special Agents the requirement that any person who is under arrest for an offense under FBI jurisdiction, or whose arrest is contemplated following the interview, must also be advised of his right to free counsel if he is unable to pay, and the fact that such counsel will be assigned by the Judge.  At the same time, we broadened the right to counsel warning \n  \n to read counsel of his own choice, or anyone else with whom he might wish to speak.\"\n\"   (2) When is the warning given?\"\n\"   The FBI warning is given to a suspect at the very outset of the interview, as shown in the  Westover  case, cited above.  The warning may be given to a person arrested as soon as practicable after the arrest, as shown in the  Jackson  case, also cited above, and in  U.S. v. Konigsberg,  336 F.2d 844 (1964),  cert. den.,  379 U.S. 933, but, in any event, it must precede the interview with the person for a confession or admission of his own guilt.\"\n\"   (3) What is the Bureau's practice in the event that (a) the individual requests counsel and (b) counsel appears?\"\n\"   When the person who has been warned of his right to counsel decides that he wishes to consult with counsel before making a statement, the interview is terminated at that point,  Shultz v. U.S.,  351 F.2d 287 (1965).  It may be continued, however, as to all matters other than the person's own guilt or innocence.  If he is indecisive in his request for counsel, there may be some question on whether he did or did not waive counsel.  Situations of this kind must necessarily be left to the judgment of the interviewing Agent.  For example, in  Hiram v. U.S.,  354 F.2d 4 (1965), the Agent's conclusion that the person arrested had waived his right to counsel was upheld by the courts.\"\n\n\"   A person being interviewed and desiring to consult counsel by telephone must be permitted to do so, as shown in  Caldwell v. U.S.,  351 F.2d 459 (1965).  When counsel appears in person, he is permitted to confer with his client in private. \"\n  \n\"   (4) What is the Bureau's practice if the individual requests counsel, but cannot afford to retain an attorney?\"\n\"   If any person being interviewed after warning of counsel decides that he wishes to consult with counsel before proceeding, further the interview is terminated, as shown above.  FBI Agents do not pass judgment on the ability of the person to pay for counsel.  They do, however, advise those who have been arrested for an offense under FBI jurisdiction, or whose arrest is contemplated following the interview, of a right to free counsel if they are unable to pay, and the availability of such counsel from the Judge. [ Footnote 55 ]\"\nThe practice of the FBI can readily be emulated by state and local enforcement agencies.  The argument that the FBI deals with different crimes than are dealt with by state authorities does not mitigate the significance of the FBI experience. [ Footnote 56 ]\n\nThe experience in some other countries also suggests that the danger to law enforcement in curbs on interrogation is overplayed.  The English procedure, since 1912 under the Judges' Rules, is significant.  As recently \n\n strengthened, the Rules require that a cautionary warning be given an accused by a police officer as soon as he has evidence that affords reasonable grounds for suspicion; they also require that any statement made be given by the accused without questioning by police. [ Footnote 57 ]  \n\n The right of the individual to consult with an attorney during this period is expressly recognized. [ Footnote 58 ]\n\nThe safeguards present under Scottish law may be even greater than in England.  Scottish judicial decisions bar use in evidence of most confessions obtained through police interrogation. [ Footnote 59 ]  In India, confessions made to police not in the presence of a magistrate have been excluded \n\n by rule of evidence since 1872, at a time when it operated under British law. [ Footnote 60 ]  Identical provisions appear in the Evidence Ordinance of Ceylon, enacted in 1895. [ Footnote 61 ]  Similarly, in our country, the Uniform Code of Military Justice has long provided that no suspect may be interrogated without first being warned of his right not to make a statement, and that any statement he makes may be used against him. [ Footnote 62 ]  Denial of the right to consult counsel during interrogation has also been proscribed by military tribunals. [ Footnote 63 ]  There appears to have been no marked detrimental effect on criminal law enforcement in these jurisdictions as a result of these rules.  Conditions of law enforcement in our country are sufficiently similar to permit reference to this experience as assurance that lawlessness will not result from warning an individual of his rights or allowing him to exercise them.  Moreover, it is consistent with our legal system that we give at least as much protection to these rights as is given in the jurisdictions described.  We deal in our country with rights grounded in a specific requirement of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, \n\n whereas other jurisdictions arrived at their conclusions on the basis of principles of justice not so specifically defined. [ Footnote 64 ]\n\nIt is also urged upon us that we withhold decision on this issue until state legislative bodies and advisory groups have had an opportunity to deal with these problems by rulemaking. [ Footnote 65 ]  We have already pointed out that the Constitution does not require any specific code of procedures for protecting the privilege against self-incrimination during custodial interrogation.  Congress and the States are free to develop their own safeguards for the privilege, so long as they are fully as effective as those described above in informing accused persons of their right of silence and in affording a continuous opportunity to exercise it.  In any event, however, the issues presented are of constitutional dimensions, and must be determined by the courts.  The admissibility of a statement in the face of a claim that it was obtained in violation of the defendant's constitutional rights is an issue the resolution of which has long since been undertaken by this Court.   See Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574  (1884).  Judicial solutions to problems of constitutional dimension have evolved decade by decade.  As courts have been presented with the need to enforce constitutional rights, they have found means of doing so.  That was our responsibility when  Escobedo  was before us, and it is our \n\n responsibility today.  Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rulemaking or legislation which would abrogate them.\n V \nBecause of the nature of the problem and because of its recurrent significance in numerous cases, we have to this point discussed the relationship of the Fifth Amendment privilege to police interrogation without specific concentration on the facts of the cases before us.  We turn now to these facts to consider the application to these cases of the constitutional principles discussed above.  In each instance, we have concluded that statements were obtained from the defendant under circumstances that did not meet constitutional standards for protection of the privilege.\nNo. 759.   Miranda v. Arizona \n\nOn March 13, 1963, petitioner, Ernesto Miranda, was arrested at his home and taken in custody to a Phoenix police station.  He was there identified by the complaining witness.  The police then took him to \"Interrogation Room No. 2\" of the detective bureau.  There he was questioned by two police officers.  The officers admitted at trial that Miranda was not advised that he had a right to have an attorney present. [ Footnote 66 ]  Two hours later, the \n\n officers emerged from the interrogation room with a written confession signed by Miranda.  At the top of the statement was a typed paragraph stating that the confession was made voluntarily, without threats or promises of immunity and \"with full knowledge of my legal rights, understanding any statement I make may be used against me.\" [ Footnote 67 ]\nAt his trial before a jury, the written confession was admitted into evidence over the objection of defense counsel, and the officers testified to the prior oral confession made by Miranda during the interrogation.  Miranda was found guilty of kidnapping and rape.  He was sentenced to 20 to 30 years' imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently.  On appeal, the Supreme Court of Arizona held that Miranda's constitutional rights were not violated in obtaining the confession, and affirmed the conviction.  98 Ariz. 18, 401 P.2d 721.  In reaching its decision, the court emphasized heavily the fact that Miranda did not specifically request counsel.\n\nWe reverse.  From the testimony of the officers and by the admission of respondent, it is clear that Miranda was not in any way apprised of his right to consult with an attorney and to have one present during the interrogation, nor was his right not to be compelled to incriminate himself effectively protected in any other manner.  Without these warnings, the statements were inadmissible.  The mere fact that he signed a statement which contained a typed-in clause stating that he had \"full knowledge\" of his \"legal rights\" does not approach the knowing and intelligent waiver required to relinquish constitutional rights.   Cf.   373 U. S.   Washington,  373 U.S. \n\nNo. 760.   Vignera v. New York \nPetitioner, Michael Vignera, was picked up by New York police on October 14, 1960, in connection with the robbery three days earlier of a Brooklyn dress shop.  They took him to the 17th Detective Squad headquarters in Manhattan.  Sometime thereafter, he was taken to the 66th Detective Squad.  There a detective questioned Vignera with respect to the robbery.  Vignera orally admitted the robbery to the detective.  The detective was asked on cross-examination at trial by defense counsel whether Vignera was warned of his right to counsel before being interrogated.  The prosecution objected to the question, and the trial judge sustained the objection.  Thus, the defense was precluded from making any showing that warnings had not been given.  While at the 66th Detective Squad, Vignera was identified by the store owner and a saleslady as the man who robbed the dress shop.  At about 3 p.m., he was formally arrested.  The police then transported him to still another station, the 70th Precinct in Brooklyn, \"for detention.\"  At 11 p.m., Vignera was questioned by an assistant district attorney in the presence of a hearing reporter, who transcribed the questions and Vignera's answers.  This verbatim account of these proceedings contains no statement of any warnings given by the assistant district attorney.  At Vignera's trial on a charge of first degree robbery, the detective testified as to the oral confession.  The transcription of the statement taken was also introduced in evidence.  At the conclusion of the testimony, the trial judge charged the jury in part as follows:\n\n\"The law doesn't say that the confession is void or invalidated because the police officer didn't advise the defendant as to his rights.  Did you hear what \n  \n I said?  I am telling you what the law of the State of New York is.\"\nVignera was found guilty of first degree robbery.  He was subsequently adjudged a third-felony offender and sentenced to 30 to 60 years' imprisonment. [ Footnote 68 ]  The conviction was affirmed without opinion by the Appellate Division, Second Department, 21 App.Div.2d 752, 252 N.Y.S.2d 19, and by the Court of Appeals, also without opinion, 15 N.Y.2d 970, 207 N.E.2d 527, 259 N.Y.S.2d 857,  remittitur amended,  16 N.Y.2d 614, 209 N.E.2d 110, 261 N.Y. .2d 65.  In argument to the Court of Appeals, the State contended that Vignera had no constitutional right to be advised of his right to counsel or his privilege against self-incrimination.\nWe reverse.  The foregoing indicates that Vignera was not warned of any of his rights before the questioning by the detective and by the assistant district attorney.  No other steps were taken to protect these rights.  Thus, he was not effectively apprised of his Fifth Amendment privilege or of his right to have counsel present, and his statements are inadmissible.\nNo. 761.   Westover v. United States \n\nAt approximately 9:45 p.m. on March 20, 1963, petitioner, Carl Calvin Westover, was arrested by local police in Kansas City as a suspect in two Kansas City robberies.  A report was also received from the FBI that he was wanted on a felony charge in California.  The local authorities took him to a police station and placed him in a line-up on the local charges, and, at about 11:45 p.m., he was booked.  Kansas City police interrogated Westover \n\n on the night of his arrest.  He denied any knowledge of criminal activities.  The next day, local officers interrogated him again throughout the morning.  Shortly before noon, they informed the FBI that they were through interrogating Westover and that the FBI could proceed to interrogate him.  There is nothing in the record to indicate that Westover was ever given any warning as to his rights by local police.  At noon, three special agents of the FBI continued the interrogation in a private interview room of the Kansas City Police Department, this time with respect to the robbery of a savings and loan association and  bank in Sacramento, California.  After two or two and one-half hours, Westover signed separate confessions to each of these two robberies which had been prepared by one of the agents during the interrogation.  At trial, one of the agents testified, and a paragraph on each of the statements states, that the agents advised Westover that he did not have to make a statement, that any statement he made could be used against him, and that he had the right to see an attorney.\nWestover was tried by a jury in federal court and convicted of the California robberies.  His statements were introduced at trial.  He was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run consecutively.  On appeal, the conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  342 F.2d 684.\n\nWe reverse.  On the facts of this case, we cannot find that Westover knowingly and intelligently waived his right to remain silent and his right to consult with counsel prior to the time he made the statement. [ Footnote 69 ]  At the \n\n time the FBI agents began questioning Westover, he had been in custody for over 14 hours, and had been interrogated at length during that period.  The FBI interrogation began immediately upon the conclusion of the interrogation by Kansas City police, and was conducted in local police headquarters.  Although the two law enforcement authorities are legally distinct, and the crimes for which they interrogated Westover were different, the impact on him was that of a continuous period of questioning.  There is no evidence of any warning given prior to the FBI interrogation, nor is there any evidence of an articulated waiver of rights after the FBI commenced its interrogation.  The record simply shows that the defendant did, in fact, confess a short time after being turned over to the FBI following interrogation by local police.  Despite the fact that the FBI agents gave warnings at the outset of their interview, from Westover's point of view, the warnings came at the end of the interrogation process.  In these circumstances, an intelligent waiver of constitutional rights cannot be assumed.\n\nWe do not suggest that law enforcement authorities are precluded from questioning any individual who has been held for a period of time by other authorities and interrogated by them without appropriate warnings.  A different case would be presented if an accused were taken into custody by the second authority, removed both in time and place from his original surroundings, and then adequately advised of his rights and given an opportunity to exercise them.  But here, the FBI interrogation was conducted immediately following the state interrogation in the same police station -- in the same compelling surroundings.  Thus, in obtaining a confession from Westover \n\n the federal authorities were the beneficiaries of the pressure applied by the local in-custody interrogation.  In these circumstances, the giving of warnings alone was not sufficient to protect the privilege.\nNo. 584.   California v. Stewart \nIn the course of investigating a series of purse-snatch robberies in which one of the victims had died of injuries inflicted by her assailant, respondent, Roy Allen Stewart, was pointed out to Los Angeles police as the endorser of dividend checks taken in one of the robberies.  At about 7:15 p.m., January 31, 1963, police officers went to Stewart's house and arrested him.  One of the officers asked Stewart if they could search the house, to which he replied, \"Go ahead.\"  The search turned up various items taken from the five robbery victims.  At the time of Stewart's arrest, police also arrested Stewart's wife and three other persons who were visiting him.  These four were jailed along with Stewart, and were interrogated.  Stewart was taken to the University Station of the Los Angeles Police Department, where he was placed in a cell.  During the next five days, police interrogated Stewart on nine different occasions.  Except during the first interrogation session, when he was confronted with an accusing witness, Stewart was isolated with his interrogators.\nDuring the ninth interrogation session, Stewart admitted that he had robbed the deceased and stated that he had not meant to hurt her.  Police then brought Stewart before a magistrate for the first time.  Since there was no evidence to connect them with any crime, the police then released the other four persons arrested with him.\n\nNothing in the record specifically indicates whether Stewart was or was not advised of his right to remain silent or his right to counsel.  In a number of instances, \n\n however, the interrogating officers were asked to recount everything that was said during the interrogations.  None indicated that Stewart was ever advised of his rights.\nStewart was charged with kidnapping to commit robbery, rape, and murder.  At his trial, transcripts of the first interrogation and the confession at the last interrogation were introduced in evidence.  The jury found Stewart guilty of robbery and first degree murder, and fixed the penalty as death.  On appeal, the Supreme Court of California reversed.  62 Cal.2d 571, 400 P.2d 97, 43 Cal.Rptr. 201.  It held that, under this Court's decision in  Escobedo,  Stewart should have been advised of his right to remain silent and of his right to counsel, and that it would not presume in the face of a silent record that the police advised Stewart of his rights. [ Footnote 70 ]\n\nWe affirm. [ Footnote 71 ]  In dealing with custodial interrogation, we will not presume that a defendant has been effectively apprised of his rights and that his privilege against self-incrimination has been adequately safeguarded on a record that does not show that any warnings have been given or that any effective alternative has been employed.  Nor can a knowing and intelligent waiver of \n\n these rights be assumed on a silent record.  Furthermore, Stewart's steadfast denial of the alleged offenses through eight of the nine interrogations over a period of five days is subject to no other construction than that he was compelled by persistent interrogation to forgo his Fifth Amendment privilege.\nTherefore, in accordance with the foregoing, the judgments of the Supreme Court Of Arizona in No. 759, of the New York Court of Appeals in No. 760, and of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in No. 761, are reversed.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of California in No. 584 is affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n* Together with No. 760,  Vignera v. New York,  on certiorari to the Court of Appeals of New York and No. 761,  Westover v.

Allegations that modern criminal investigation can compensate for the lack of a confession or admission in every criminal case is totally absurd!\"\nParker, 40 L.A.Bar Bull. 603, 607, 642 (1965).

The authors and their associates are officers of the Chicago Police Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory, and have had extensive experience in writing, lecturing and speaking to law enforcement authorities over a 20-year period.  They say that the techniques portrayed in their manuals reflect their experiences, and are the most effective psychological stratagems to employ during interrogations.  Similarly, the techniques described in O'Hara, Fundamentals of Criminal Investigation (1956), were gleaned from long service as observer, lecturer in police science, and work as a federal criminal investigator.  All these texts have had rather extensive use among law enforcement agencies and among students of police science, with total sales and circulation of over 44,000.\n[ Footnote 10 ]\nInbau & Reid, Criminal Interrogation and Confessions (1962), at 1.\n[ Footnote 11 ]\nO'Hara,  supra,  at 99.\n[ Footnote 12 ]\nInbau & Reid,  supra,  at 34-43, 87.  For example, in  Leyra v. Denno, 347 U. S. 556  (1954), the interrogator-psychiatrist told the accused, \"We do sometimes things that are not right, but in a fit of temper or anger we sometimes do things we aren't really responsible for,\"  id.  at 562 , and again, \"We know that morally, you were just in anger.  Morally, you are not to be condemned,\"  id.  at 582 .\n[ Footnote 13 ]\nInbau  Reid,  supra,  at 43-55.\n[ Footnote 14 ]\nO'Hara,  supra,  at 112.\n[ Footnote 15 ]\nInbau & Reid,  supra,  at 40.\n[ Footnote 16 ]\n Ibid. \n[ Footnote 17 ]\nO'Hara,  supra,  at 104, Inbau & Reid,  supra,  at 58-59.   See Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315  (1959).  A variant on the technique of creating hostility is one of engendering fear.  This is perhaps best described by the prosecuting attorney in  Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401 ,   324 U. S. 407  (1945):\n\"Why this talk about being undressed?  Of course, they had a right to undress him to look for bullet scars, and keep the clothes off him.  That was quite proper police procedure.  That is some more psychology -- let him sit around with a blanket on him, humiliate him there for a while; let him sit in the corner, let him think he is going to get a shellacking.\"\n[ Footnote 18 ]\nO'Hara,  supra,  at 105-106.\n[ Footnote 19 ]\n Id.  at 106.\n[ Footnote 20 ]\nInbau & Reid,  supra,  at 111.\n[ Footnote 21 ]\n Ibid. \n[ Footnote 22 ]\nInbau & Reid,  supra,  at 112.\n[ Footnote 23 ]\nInbau & Reid, Lie Detection and Criminal Interrogation 185 (3d ed.1953).\n[ Footnote 24 ]\nInterrogation procedures may even give rise to a false confession.  The most recent conspicuous example occurred in New York, in 1964, when a Negro of limited intelligence confessed to two brutal murders and a rape which he had not committed.  When this was discovered, the prosecutor was reported as saying:\n\"Call it what you want -- brainwashing, hypnosis, fright.  They made him give an untrue confession.  The only thing I don't believe is that Whitmore was beaten.\"\nN.Y. Times, Jan. 28, 1965, p. 1, col. 5.  In two other instances, similar events had occurred.  N.Y. Times, Oct. 20, 1964, p. 22, col. 1; N.Y. Times, Aug. 25, 1965, p. 1, col. 1.  In general,  see  Borchard, Convicting the Innocent (1932); Frank & Frank, Not Guilty (1957).\n[ Footnote 25 ]\nIn the fourth confession case decided by the Court in the 1962 Term,  Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391  (1963), our disposition made it unnecessary to delve at length into the facts.  The facts of the defendant's case there, however, paralleled those of his codefendants, whose confessions were found to have resulted from continuous and coercive interrogation for 27 hours, with denial of requests for friends or attorney.   See United States v. Murphy,  222 F.2d 698 (C.A.2d Cir.1955) (Frank, J.);  People v. Bonino,  1 N.Y.2d 752, 135 N.E.2d 51 (1956).\n[ Footnote 26 ]\nThe absurdity of denying that a confession obtained under these circumstances is compelled is aptly portrayed by an example in Professor Sutherland's recent article, Crime and Confession, 79 Harv.L.Rev. 21, 37 (1965):\n\"Suppose a well-to-do testatrix says she intends to will her property to Elizabeth.  John and James want her to bequeath it to them instead.  They capture the testatrix, put her in a carefully designed room, out of touch with everyone but themselves and their convenient 'witnesses,' keep her secluded there for hours while they make insistent demands, weary her with contradictions of her assertions that she wants to leave her money to Elizabeth, and finally induce her to execute the will in their favor.  Assume that John and James are deeply and correctly convinced that Elizabeth is unworthy, and will make base use of the property if she gets her hands on it, whereas John and James have the noblest and most righteous intentions.  Would any judge of probate accept the will so procured as the 'voluntary' act of the testatrix?\"\n[ Footnote 27 ]\nThirteenth century commentators found an analogue to the privilege grounded in the Bible.  \"To sum up the matter, the principle that no man is to be declared guilty on his own admission is a divine decree.\"  Maimonides, Mishneh Torah (Code of Jewish Law), Book of Judges, Laws of the Sanhedrin, c. 18, 116, III Yale Judaica Series 52-53.

S. 332  (1943).\n[ Footnote 32 ]\nOur decision today does not indicate in any manner, of course, that these rules can be disregarded.  When federal officials arrest an individual, they must as always comply with the dictates of the congressional legislation and cases thereunder.   See generally  Hogan & Snee, The  McNabb-Mallory  Rule:  Its Rise, Rationale and Rescue, 47 Geo.L.J. 1 (1958).\n[ Footnote 33 ]\nThe decisions of this Court have guaranteed the same procedural protection for the defendant whether his confession was used in a federal or state court.  It is now axiomatic that the defendant's constitutional rights have been violated if his conviction is based, in whole or in part, on an involuntary confession, regardless of its truth or falsity.   Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534 ,   365 U. S. 544  (1961);  Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1  (1924).  This is so even if there is ample evidence aside from the confession to support the conviction,  e.g., Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401 ,   324 U. S. 404  (1945);  Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532 ,   168 U. S. 540 -542 (1897).  Both state and federal courts now adhere to trial procedures which seek to assure a reliable and clear-cut determination of the voluntariness of the confession offered at trial,  Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368  (1964);  United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36 ,   342 U. S. 38  (1951);  see also Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613 ,   162 U. S. 624  (1896).  Appellate review is exacting,  see Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503  (1963);  Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S. 199  (1960).  Whether his conviction was in a federal or state court, the defendant may secure a post-conviction hearing based on the alleged involuntary character of his confession, provided he meets the procedural requirements,  Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391  (1963);  Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293  (1963).  In addition,  see Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U. S. 52  (1964).\n[ Footnote 34 ]\n See Lisenba v. California, 314 U.

S. 528  (1963);  Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503  (1963).\n[ Footnote 35 ]\nThe police also prevented the attorney from consulting with his client.  Independent of any other constitutional proscription, this action constitutes a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel, and excludes any statement obtained in its wake.   See People v. Donovan,  13 N.Y.2d 148, 193 N.E.2d 628, 243 N.Y.S.2d 841 (1963) (Fuld, J.)\n[ Footnote 36 ]\n In re Groban, 352 U. S. 330 ,   352 U.

The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation.   Cf. Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609  (1965);  Malloy v.

As was stated in the Report of the Attorney General's Committee on Poverty and the Administration of Federal Criminal Justice 9 (1963):\n\"When government chooses to exert its powers in the criminal area, its obligation is surely no less than that of taking reasonable measures to eliminate those factors that are irrelevant to just administration of the law, but which, nevertheless, may occasionally affect determinations of the accused's liability or penalty.  While government may not be required to relieve the accused of his poverty, it may properly be required to minimize the influence of poverty on its administration of justice.\"\n[ Footnote 42 ]\n Cf. United States ex rel. Brown v. Fay,  242 F.Supp. 273, 277 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.1965);  People v. Witenski,  15 N.Y.2d 392, 207 N.E.2d 358, 259 N.Y.S.2d 413 (1965).\n[ Footnote 43 ]\nWhile a warning that the indigent may have counsel appointed need not be given to the person who is known to have an attorney or is known to have ample funds to secure one, the expedient of giving a warning is too simple, and the rights involved too important, to engage in  ex post facto  inquiries into financial ability when there is any doubt at all on that score.\n[ Footnote 44 ]\nIf an individual indicates his desire to remain silent, but has an attorney present, there may be some circumstances in which further questioning would be permissible.  In the absence of evidence of overbearing, statements then made in the presence of counsel might be free of the compelling influence of the interrogation process and might fairly be construed as a waiver of the privilege for purposes of these statements.\n[ Footnote 45 ]\nAlthough this Court held in  Rogers v. United States, 340 U. S. 367  (1951), over strong dissent, that a witness before a grand jury may not in certain circumstances decide to answer some questions and then refuse to answer others, that decision has no application to the interrogation situation we deal with today.  No legislative or judicial factfinding authority is involved here, nor is there a possibility that the individual might make self-serving statements of which he could make use at trial while refusing to answer incriminating statements.\n[ Footnote 46 ]\nThe distinction and its significance has been aptly described in the opinion of a Scottish court:\n\"In former times, such questioning, if undertaken, would be conducted by police officers visiting the house or place of business of the suspect and there questioning him, probably in the presence of a relation or friend.  However convenient the modern practice may be, it must normally create a situation very unfavourable to the suspect.\"\n Chalmer v. H. M.

Marked bills from the bank robbed were found in Westover's car.  Articles stolen from the victim as well as from several other robbery victims were found in Stewart's home at the outset of the investigation.\n[ Footnote 52 ]\nDealing as we do here with constitutional standards in relation to statements made, the existence of independent corroborating evidence produced at trial is, of course, irrelevant to our decisions.

An extreme example of this practice occurred in the District of Columbia in 1958.  Seeking three \"stocky\" young Negroes who had robbed a restaurant, police rounded up 90 persons of that general description.  Sixty-three were held overnight before being released for lack of evidence.  A man not among the 90 arrested was ultimately charged with the crime.

Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, stated:\n\"Law enforcement, however, in defeating the criminal, must maintain inviolate the historic liberties of the individual.  To turn back the criminal, yet, by so doing, destroy the dignity of the individual, would be a hollow victory.\"\n\" *    *    *    *\"  \n\"We can have the Constitution, the best laws in the land, and the most honest reviews by courts -- but unless the law enforcement profession is steeped in the democratic tradition, maintains the highest in ethics, and makes its work a career of honor, civil liberties will continually -- and without end -- be violated. . . .  The best protection of civil liberties is an alert, intelligent and honest law enforcement agency.  There can be no alternative.\"\n\" *    *    *    *\"  \n\". . .  Special Agents are taught that any suspect or arrested person, at the outset of an interview, must be advised that he is not required to make a statement and that any statement given can be used against him in court.  Moreover, the individual must be informed that, if he desires, he may obtain the services of an attorney of his own choice.\"\nHoover, Civil Liberties and Law Enforcement:  The Role of the FBI, 37 Iowa L.Rev. 175, 177-182 (1952).\n[ Footnote 55 ]\nWe agree that the interviewing agent must exercise his judgment in determining whether the individual waives his right to counsel.  Because of the constitutional basis of the right, however, the standard for waiver is necessarily high.

As soon as a police officer has evidence which would afford reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person has committed an offence, he shall caution that person or cause him to be cautioned before putting to him any questions, or further questions, relating to that offence.\"\n\"The caution shall be in the following terms:  \"\n\"   You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but what you say may be put into writing and given in evidence.\"\n\"When, after being cautioned a person is being questioned, or elects to make a statement, a record shall be kept of the time and place at which any such questioning or statement began and ended and of the persons present.\"\n\"III  . . . \"\n\" *    *    *    *                         .\"  \n\"(b) It is only in exceptional cases that questions relating to the offence should be put to the accused person after he has been charged or informed that he may be prosecuted.\"\n\" *    *    *    *\"  \n\"IV.

Once the accused has been apprehended and charged, he has the statutory right to a private interview with a solicitor and to be brought before a magistrate with all convenient speed so that he may, if so advised, emit a declaration in presence of his solicitor under conditions which safeguard him against prejudice.\"\n[ Footnote 60 ]\n\"No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence.\"  Indian Evidence Act § 25.\n\"No confession made by any person whilst he is in the custody of a police officer unless it be made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate, shall be proved as against such person.\"\nIndian Evidence Act § 26.   See  1 Ramaswami & Rajagopalan, Law of Evidence in India 553-569 (1962).  To avoid any continuing effect of police pressure or inducement, the Indian Supreme Court has invalidated a confession made shortly after police brought a suspect before a magistrate, suggesting:\n\"[I]t would, we think, be reasonable to insist upon giving an accused person at least 24 hours to decide whether or not he should make a confession.\"\n Sarwan Singh v.

A statement introduced at that trial was obtained from Miranda during the same interrogation which resulted in the confession involved here.  At the robbery trial, one officer testified that, during the interrogation, he did not tell Miranda that anything he said would be held against him or that he could consult with an attorney.  The other officer stated that they had both told Miranda that anything he said would be used against him and that he was not required by law to tell them anything.\n[ Footnote 67 ]\nOne of the officers testified that he read this paragraph to Miranda.

The church seats about 230 worshippers, a number too small for its growing parish. Some 40 to 60 parishioners cannot be accommodated at some Sunday masses. In order to meet the needs of the congregation the Archbishop of San Antonio gave permission to the parish to plan alterations to enlarge the building.\nA few months later, the Boerne City Council passed an ordinance authorizing the city's Historic Landmark Commission to prepare a preservation plan with proposed historic landmarks and districts. Under the ordinance, the commission must preapprove construction affecting historic landmarks or buildings in a historic district.\nSoon afterwards, the Archbishop applied for a building permit so construction to enlarge the church could proceed. City authorities, relying on the ordinance and the designation of a historic district (which, they argued, included the church), denied the application. The Archbishop brought this suit challenging the permit denial in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. 877\nThe complaint contained various claims, but to this point the litigation has centered on RFRA and the question of its constitutionality. The Archbishop relied upon RFRA as one basis for relief from the refusal to issue the permit. The District Court concluded that by enacting RFRA Congress exceeded the scope of its enforcement power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court certified its order for interlocutory appeal and the Fifth Circuit reversed, finding RFRA to be constitutional.  73 F.3d 1352  (1996). We granted certiorari, 519 U. S. 926 (1996), and now reverse. \nII \nCongress enacted RFRA in direct response to the Court's decision in  Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore.  v.  Smith,  494 U. S. 872  (1990). There we considered a Free Exercise Clause claim brought by members of the 513 \nNative American Church who were denied unemployment benefits when they lost their jobs because they had used peyote. Their practice was to ingest peyote for sacramental purposes, and they challenged an Oregon statute of general applicability which made use of the drug criminal. In evaluating the claim, we declined to apply the balancing test set forth in  Sherbert  v.  Verner,  374 U. S. 398  (1963), under which we would have asked whether Oregon's prohibition substantially burdened a religious practice and, if it did, whether the burden was justified by a compelling government interest. We stated: \n\"[G]overnment's ability to enforce generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct ... cannot depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector's spiritual development. To make an individual's obligation to obey such a law contingent upon the law's coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State's interest is 'compelling' ... contradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense.\" 494 U. S., at 885 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nThe application of the  Sherbert  test, the  Smith  decision explained, would have produced an anomaly in the law, a constitutional right to ignore neutral laws of general applicability. The anomaly would have been accentuated, the Court reasoned, by the difficulty of determining whether a particular practice was central to an individual's religion. We explained, moreover, that it \"is not within the judicial ken to question the centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity of particular litigants' interpretations of those creeds.\" 494 U. S., at 887 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nThe only instances where a neutral, generally applicable law had failed to pass constitutional muster, the  Smith  Court 514 \nnoted, were cases in which other constitutional protections were at stake.  Id.,  at 881-882. In  Wisconsin  v.  Yoder,  406 U. S. 205  (1972), for example, we invalidated Wisconsin's mandatory school-attendance law as applied to Amish parents who refused on religious grounds to send their children to school. That case implicated not only the right to the free exercise of religion but also the right of parents to control their children's education.\nThe  Smith  decision acknowledged the Court had employed the  Sherbert  test in considering free exercise challenges to state unemployment compensation rules on three occasions where the balance had tipped in favor of the individual. See  Sherbert, supra; Thomas  v.  Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div.,  450 U. S. 707  (1981);  Hobbie  v.  Unemployment Appeals Comm'n of Fla.,  480 U. S. 136  (1987). Those cases, the Court explained, stand for \"the proposition that where the State has in place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of religious hardship without compelling reason.\" 494 U. S., at 884 (internal quotation marks omitted). By contrast, where a general prohibition, such as Oregon's, is at issue, \"the sounder approach, and the approach in accord with the vast majority of our precedents, is to hold the test inapplicable to [free exercise] challenges.\"  Id.,  at 885.  Smith  held that neutral, generally applicable laws may be applied to religious practices even when not supported by a compelling governmental interest.\n\n 515 \nThese points of constitutional interpretation were debated by Members of Congress in hearings and floor debates. Many criticized the Court's reasoning, and this disagreement resulted in the passage of RFRA. Congress announced: \nThe Act's stated purposes are:\nRFRA prohibits \"[g]overnment\" from \"substantially burden[ing]\" a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability unless the government can demonstrate the burden \"(1) is in furtherance of 516 \na compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\" § 2000bb-1. The Act's mandate applies to any \"branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official (or other person acting under color oflaw) of the United States,\" as well as to any \"State, or ... subdivision of a State.\" § 2000bb-2(1). The Act's universal coverage is confirmed in § 2000bb-3(a), under which RFRA \"applies to all Federal and State law, and the implementation of that law, whether statutory or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after [RFRA's enactment].\" In accordance with RFRA's usage of the term, we shall use \"state law\" to include local and municipal ordinances. \nIII A \nUnder our Constitution, the Federal Government is one of enumerated powers.  McCulloch  v.  Maryland,  4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819); see also The Federalist No. 45, p. 292 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). The judicial authority to determine the constitutionality of laws, in cases and controversies, is based on the premise that the \"powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written.\"  Marbury  v.  Madison,  1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803).\nCongress relied on its Fourteenth Amendment enforcement power in enacting the most far-reaching and substantial of RFRA's provisions, those which impose its requirements on the States. See Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, S. Rep. No. 103-111, pp. 13-14 (1993) (Senate Report); H. R. Rep. No. 103-88, p. 9 (1993) (House Report). The Fourteenth Amendment provides, in relevant part: \n\"Section 1. ... No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due proc- 517 \n\"Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\" \nThe parties disagree over whether RFRA is a proper exercise of Congress' § 5 power \"to enforce\" by \"appropriate legislation\" the constitutional guarantee that no State shall deprive any person of \"life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,\" nor deny any person \"equal protection of the laws.\"\nIn defense of the Act, respondent the Archbishop contends, with support from the United States, that RFRA is permissible enforcement legislation. Congress, it is said, is only protecting by legislation one of the liberties guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the free exercise of religion, beyond what is necessary under  Smith.  It is said the congressional decision to dispense with proof of deliberate or overt discrimination and instead concentrate on a law's effects accords with the settled understanding that § 5 includes the power to enact legislation designed to prevent, as well as remedy, constitutional violations. It is further contended that Congress' § 5 power is not limited to remedial or preventive legislation.\nAll must acknowledge that § 5 is \"a positive grant of legislative power\" to Congress,  Katzenbach  v.  Morgan,  384 U. S. 641 , 651 (1966). In  Ex parte Virginia,  100 U. S. 339 , 345346 (1880), we explained the scope of Congress' § 5 power in the following broad terms: \n\"Whatever legislation is appropriate, that is, adapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in view, whatever tends to enforce submission to the prohibitions they contain, and to secure to all persons the enjoyment of perfect equality of civil rights and the equal protection of the laws against State denial or invasion, if not 518 \nprohibited, is brought within the domain of congressional power.\" \nLegislation which deters or remedies constitutional violations can fall within the sweep of Congress' enforcement power even if in the process it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and intrudes into \"legislative spheres of autonomy previously reserved to the States.\"  Fitzpatrick  v.  Bitzer,  427 U. S. 445 , 455 (1976). For example, the Court upheld a suspension of literacy tests and similar voting requirements under Congress' parallel power to enforce the provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment, see U. S. Const., Amdt. 15, § 2, as a measure to combat racial discrimination in voting,  South Carolina  v.  Katzenbach,  383 U. S. 301 , 308 (1966), despite the facial constitutionality of the tests under  Lassiter  v.  Northampton County Bd. of Elections,  360 U. S. 45  (1959). We have also concluded that other measures protecting voting rights are within Congress' power to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, despite the burdens those measures placed on the States.  South Carolina  v.  Katzenbach, supra  (upholding several provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965);  Katzenbach  v.  Morgan, supra  (upholding ban on literacy tests that prohibited certain people schooled in Puerto Rico from voting);  Oregon  v.  Mitchell,  400 U. S. 112  (1970) (upholding 5-year nationwide ban on literacy tests and similar voting requirements for registering to vote);  City of Rome  v.  United States,  446 U. S. 156 , 161 (1980) (upholding 7-year extension of the Voting Rights Act's requirement that certain jurisdictions preclear any change to a \"'standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting' \"); see also  James Everard's Breweries  v.  Day,  265 U. S. 545  (1924) (upholding ban on medical prescription of intoxicating malt liquors as appropriate to enforce Eighteenth Amendment ban on manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes).\nIt is also true, however, that \"[a]s broad as the congressional enforcement power is, it is not unlimited.\"  Oregon  v. 519 Mitchell, supra,  at 128 (opinion of Black J.). In assessing the breadth of § 5's enforcement power, we begin with its text. Congress has been given the power \"to enforce\" the \"provisions of this article.\" We agree with respondent, of course, that Congress can enact legislation under § 5 enforcing the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. The \"provisions of this article,\" to which § 5 refers, include the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Congress' power to enforce the Free Exercise Clause follows from our holding in  Cantwell  v.  Connecticut,  310 U. S. 296 , 303 (1940), that the \"fundamental concept of liberty embodied in [the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause] embraces the liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment.\" See also  United States  v.  Price,  383 U. S. 787 , 789 (1966) (there is \"no doubt of the power of Congress to enforce by appropriate criminal sanction every right guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\nCongress' power under § 5, however, extends only to \"enforc[ing]\" the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court has described this power as \"remedial,\"  South Carolina  v.  Katzenbach, supra,  at 326. The design of the Amendment and the text of § 5 are inconsistent with the suggestion that Congress has the power to decree the substance of the Fourteenth Amendment's restrictions on the States. Legislation which alters the meaning of the Free Exercise Clause cannot be said to be enforcing the Clause. Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is. It has been given the power \"to enforce,\" not the power to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation. Were it not so, what Congress would be enforcing would no longer be, in any meaningful sense, the \"provisions of [the Fourteenth Amendment].\"\nWhile the line between measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions and measures that make a substantive change in the governing law is not easy to discern, and 520 \nCongress must have wide latitude in determining where it lies, the distinction exists and must be observed. There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end. Lacking such a connection, legislation may become substantive in operation and effect. History and our case law support drawing the distinction, one apparent from the text of the Amendment. \n1 \nThe Fourteenth Amendment's history confirms the remedial, rather than substantive, nature of the Enforcement Clause. The Joint Committee on Reconstruction of the 39th Congress began drafting what would become the Fourteenth Amendment in January 1866. The objections to the Committee's first draft of the Amendment, and the rejection of the draft, have a direct bearing on the central issue of defining Congress' enforcement power. In February, Republican Representative John Bingham of Ohio reported the following draft Amendment to the House of Representatives on behalf of the Joint Committee: \nThe proposal encountered immediate opposition, which continued through three days of debate. Members of Congress from across the political spectrum criticized the Amendment, and the criticisms had a common theme: The proposed Amendment gave Congress too much legislative power at the expense of the existing constitutional structure. E. g., id., at 1063-1065 (statement of Rep. Hale); id., at 1082 521 \n(statement of Sen. Stewart); id., at 1095 (statement of Rep. Hotchkiss); id., at App. 133-135 (statement of Rep. Rogers). Democrats and conservative Republicans argued that the proposed Amendment would give Congress a power to intrude into traditional areas of state responsibility, a power inconsistent with the federal design central to the Constitution. Typifying these views, Republican Representative Robert Hale of New York labeled the Amendment \"an utter departure from every principle ever dreamed of by the men who framed our Constitution,\" id., at 1063, and warned that under it \"all State legislation, in its codes of civil and criminal jurisprudence and procedure ... may be overridden, may be repealed or abolished, and the law of Congress established instead.\"  Ibid.  Senator William Stewart of Nevada likewise stated the Amendment would permit \"Congress to legislate fully upon all subjects affecting life, liberty, and property,\" such that \"there would not be much left for the State Legislatures,\" and would thereby \"work an entire change in our form of government.\"  Id.,  at 1082; accord,  id.,  at 1087 (statement of Rep. Davis); id., at App. 133 (statement of Rep. Rogers). Some radicals, like their brethren \"unwilling that Congress shall have any such power ... to establish uniform laws throughout the United States upon ... the protection of life, liberty, and property,\" id., at 1095 (statement of Rep. Hotchkiss), also objected that giving Congress primary responsibility for enforcing legal equality would place power in the hands of changing congressional majorities,  ibid.  See generally Bickel, The Original Understanding and the Segregation Decision, 69 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 57 (1955); Graham, Our \"Declaratory\" Fourteenth Amendment, 7 Stan. L. Rev. 3, 21 (1954).\nAs a result of these objections having been expressed from so many different quarters, the House voted to table the proposal until April. See,  e.  g., B. Kendrick, Journal of the Joint Committee of Fifteen on Reconstruction 215, 217 (1914); Congo Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 115 (1871) (statement 522 \nof Rep. Farnsworth). The congressional action was seen as marking the defeat of the proposal. See The Nation, Mar. 8, 1866, p. 291 (\"The postponement of the amendment ... is conclusive against the passage of [it]\"); New York Times, Mar. 1, 1866, p. 4 (\"It is doubtful if this ever comes before the House again ... \"); see also Congo Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., at App. 115 (statement of Rep. Farnsworth) (The Amendment was \"given its quietus by a postponement for two months, where it slept the sleep that knows no waking\"). The measure was defeated \"chiefly because many members of the legal profession s[aw] in [it] ... a dangerous centralization of power,\" The Nation,  supra,  at 291, and \"many leading Republicans of thee] House [of Representatives] would not consent to so radical a change in the Constitution,\" Congo Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., at App. 151 (statement of Rep. Garfield). The Amendment in its early form was not again considered. Instead, the Joint Committee began drafting a new article of Amendment, which it reported to Congress on April 30, 1866.\nSection 1 of the new draft Amendment imposed selfexecuting limits on the States. Section 5 prescribed that \"[t]he Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\" See Congo Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 2286. Under the revised Amendment, Congress' power was no longer plenary but remedial. Congress was granted the power to make the substantive constitutional prohibitions against the States effective. Representative Bingham said the new draft would give Congress \"the power ... to protect by national law the privileges and immunities of all the citizens of the Republic ... whenever the same shall be abridged or denied by the unconstitutional acts of any State.\"  Id.,  at 2542. Representative Stevens described the new draft Amendment as \"allow[ing] Congress to correct the unjust legislation of the States.\"  Id.,  at 2459. See also  id.,  at 2768 (statement of Sen. Howard) (§ 5 \"enables Congress, in case the States shall enact 523 \nlaws in conflict with the principles of the amendment, to correct that legislation by a formal congressional enactment\"). See generally H. Brannon, The Rights and Privileges Guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States 387 (1901) (Congress' \"powers are only prohibitive, corrective, vetoing, aimed only at undue process of law\"); id., at 420, 452-455 (same); T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 294, n. 1 (2d ed. 1871) (\"This amendment of the Constitution does not concentrate power in the general government for any purpose of police government within the States; its object is to preclude legislation by any State which shall 'abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States' \"). The revised Amendment proposal did not raise the concerns expressed earlier regarding broad congressional power to prescribe uniform national laws with respect to life, liberty, and property. See,  e.  g., Congo Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., at App. 151 (statement of Rep. Garfield) (\"The [Fourteenth Amendment] limited but did not oust the jurisdiction of the State[s]\"). After revisions not relevant here, the new measure passed both Houses and was ratified in July 1868 as the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThe significance of the defeat of the Bingham proposal was apparent even then. During the debates over the Ku Klux Klan Act only a few years after the Amendment's ratification, Representative James Garfield argued there were limits on Congress' enforcement power, saying \"unless we ignore both the history and the language of these clauses we cannot, by any reasonable interpretation, give to [§ 5] ... the force and effect of the rejected [Bingham] clause.\"  Ibid.;  see also id., at App. 115-116 (statement of Rep. Farnsworth). Scholars of successive generations have agreed with this assessment. See H. Flack, The Adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment 64 (1908); Bickel, The Voting Rights Cases, 1966\nThe design of the Fourteenth Amendment has proved significant also in maintaining the traditional separation of pow- 524 \ners between Congress and the Judiciary. The first eight Amendments to the Constitution set forth self-executing prohibitions on governmental action, and this Court has had primary authority to interpret those prohibitions. The Bingham draft, some thought, departed from that tradition by vesting in Congress primary power to interpret and elaborate on the meaning of the new Amendment through legislation. Under it, \"Congress, and not the courts, was to judge whether or not any of the privileges or immunities were not secured to citizens in the several States.\" Flack,  supra,  at 64. While this separation-of-powers aspect did not occasion the widespread resistance which was caused by the proposal's threat to the federal balance, it nonetheless attracted the attention of various Members. See Congo Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 1064 (statement of Rep. Hale) (noting that Bill of Rights, unlike the Bingham proposal, \"provide[s] safeguards to be enforced by the courts, and not to be exercised by the Legislature\"); id., at App. 133 (statement of Rep. Rogers) (prior to Bingham proposal it \"was left entirely for the courts ... to enforce the privileges and immunities of the citizens\"). As enacted, the Fourteenth Amendment confers substantive rights against the States which, like the provisions of the Bill of Rights, are self-executing. Cf.  South Carolina  v.  Katzenbach,  383 U. S., at 325 (discussing Fifteenth Amendment). The power to interpret the Constitution in a case or controversy remains in the Judiciary. \n2 \nThe remedial and preventive nature of Congress' enforcement power, and the limitation inherent in the power, were confirmed in our earliest cases on the Fourteenth Amendment. In the  Civil Rights Cases,  109 U. S. 3  (1883), the Court invalidated sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 which prescribed criminal penalties for denying to any person \"the full enjoyment of\" public accommodations and conveyances, on the grounds that it exceeded Congress' power 525 \nby seeking to regulate private conduct. The Enforcement Clause, the Court said, did not authorize Congress to pass \"general legislation upon the rights of the citizen, but corrective legislation, that is, such as may be necessary and proper for counteracting such laws as the States may adopt or enforce, and which, by the amendment, they are prohibited from making or enforcing .... \"  Id.,  at 13-14. The power to \"legislate generally upon\" life, liberty, and property, as opposed to the \"power to provide modes of redress\" against offensive state action, was \"repugnant\" to the Constitution.  Id.,  at 15. See also  United States  v.  Reese,  92 U. S. 214 , 218  (1876); United States  v.  Harris,  106 U. S. 629 , 639 (1883);  James  v.  Bowman,  190 U. S. 127 , 139 (1903). Although the specific holdings of these early cases might have been superseded or modified, see,  e. g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.  v.  United States,  379 U. S. 241  (1964);  United States  v.  Guest,  383 U. S. 745  (1966), their treatment of Congress' §5 power as corrective or preventive, not definitional, has not been questioned.\nRecent cases have continued to revolve around the question whether § 5 legislation can be considered remedial. In  South Carolina  v.  Katzenbach, supra,  we emphasized that \"[t]he constitutional propriety of [legislation adopted under the Enforcement Clause] must be judged with reference to the historical experience ... it reflects.\" 383 U. S., at 308. There we upheld various provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, finding them to be \"remedies aimed at areas where voting discrimination has been most flagrant,\" id., at 315, and necessary to \"banish the blight of racial discrimination in voting, which has infected the electoral process in parts of our country for nearly a century,\" id., at 308. We noted evidence in the record reflecting the subsisting and pervasive discriminatory-and therefore unconstitutional-use of literacy tests.  Id.,  at 333-334. The Act's new remedies, which used the administrative resources of the Federal Government, included the suspension of both literacy tests and, 526 \npending federal review, all new voting regulations in covered jurisdictions, as well as the assignment of federal examiners to list qualified applicants enabling those listed to vote. The new, unprecedented remedies were deemed necessary given the ineffectiveness of the existing voting rights laws, see id., at 313-315, and the slow, costly character of case-by-case litigation, id., at 328.\nAfter  South Carolina  v.  Katzenbach,  the Court continued to acknowledge the necessity of using strong remedial and preventive measures to respond to the widespread and persisting deprivation of constitutional rights resulting from this country's history of racial discrimination. See  Oregon  v.  Mitchell,  400 U. S., at 132 (\"In enacting the literacy test ban ... Congress had before it a long history of the discriminatory use of literacy tests to disfranchise voters on account of their race\") (opinion of Black J.); id., at 147 (Literacy tests \"have been used at times as a discriminatory weapon against some minorities, not only Negroes but Americans of Mexican ancestry, and American Indians\") (opinion of Douglas, J.); id., at 216 (\"Congress could have determined that racial prejudice is prevalent throughout the Nation, and that literacy tests unduly lend themselves to discriminatory application, either conscious or unconscious\") (opinion of Harlan, J.); id., at 235 (\"[T]here is no question but that Congress could legitimately have concluded that the use of literacy tests anywhere within the United States has the inevitable effect of denying the vote to members of racial minorities whose inability to pass such tests is the direct consequence of previous governmental discrimination in education\") (opinion of Brennan, J.); id., at 284 (\"[N]ationwide [suspension of literacy tests] may be reasonably thought appropriate when Congress acts against an evil such as racial discrimination which in varying degrees manifests itself in every part of the country\") (opinion of Stewart, J.);  City of Rome,  446 U. S., at 182 (\"Congress' considered determination that at least another 7 years of statutory remedies were necessary to counter the 527 \nperpetuation of 95 years of pervasive voting discrimination is both unsurprising and unassailable\");  Morgan,  384 U. S., at 656 (Congress had a factual basis to conclude that New York's literacy requirement \"constituted an invidious discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause\"). \n3 \nAny suggestion that Congress has a substantive, nonremedial power under the Fourteenth Amendment is not supported by our case law. In  Oregon  v.  Mitchell, supra,  at 112, a majority of the Court concluded Congress had exceeded its enforcement powers by enacting legislation lowering the minimum age of voters from 21 to 18 in state and local elections. The five Members of the Court who reached this conclusion explained that the legislation intruded into an area reserved by the Constitution to the States. See 400 U. S., at 125 (concluding that the legislation was unconstitutional because the Constitution \"reserves to the States the power to set voter qualifications in state and local elections\") (opinion of Black J.); id., at 154 (explaining that the \"Fourteenth Amendment was never intended to restrict the authority of the States to allocate their political power as they see fit\") (opinion of Harlan, J.); id., at 294 (concluding that States, not Congress, have the power \"to establish a qualification for voting based on age\") (opinion of Stewart, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Blackmun, J.). Four of these five were explicit in rejecting the position that § 5 endowed Congress with the power to establish the meaning of constitutional provisions. See id., at 209 (opinion of Harlan, J.); id., at 296 (opinion of Stewart, J.). Justice Black's rejection of this position might be inferred from his disagreement with Congress' interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause. See id., at 125.\nThere is language in our opinion in  Katzenbach  v.  Morgan,  384 U. S. 641  (1966), which could be interpreted as acknowledging a power in Congress to enact legislation that expands 528 \nthe rights contained in § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is not a necessary interpretation, however, or even the best one. In  Morgan,  the Court considered the constitutionality of §4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided that no person who had successfully completed the sixth primary grade in a public school in, or a private school accredited by, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in which the language of instruction was other than English could be denied the right to vote because of an inability to read or write English. New York's Constitution, on the other hand, required voters to be able to read and write English. The Court provided two related rationales for its conclusion that § 4(e) could \"be viewed as a measure to secure for the Puerto Rican community residing in New York nondiscriminatory treatment by government.\"  Id.,  at 652. Under the first rationale, Congress could prohibit New York from denying the right to vote to large segments of its Puerto Rican community, in order to give Puerto Ricans \"enhanced political power\" that would be \"helpful in gaining nondiscriminatory treatment in public services for the entire Puerto Rican community.\"  Ibid.  Section 4(e) thus could be justified as a remedial measure to deal with \"discrimination in governmental services.\"  Id.,  at 653. The second rationale, an alternative holding, did not address discrimination in the provision of public services but \"discrimination in establishing voter qualifications.\"  Id.,  at 654. The Court perceived a factual basis on which Congress could have concluded that New York's literacy requirement \"constituted an invidious discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\"  Id.,  at 656. Both rationales for upholding §4(e) rested on unconstitutional discrimination by New York and Congress' reasonable attempt to combat it. As Justice Stewart explained in  Oregon  v.  Mitchell, supra,  at 296, interpreting  Morgan  to give Congress the power to interpret the Constitution \"would require an enormous extension of that decision's rationale.\" 529 \nIf Congress could define its own powers by altering the Fourteenth Amendment's meaning, no longer would the Constitution be \"superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means.\" It would be \"on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other acts, ... alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it.\"  Marbury  v.  Madison,  1 Cranch at 177. Under this approach, it is difficult to conceive of a principle that would limit congressional power. See Van Alstyne, The Failure of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, 46 Duke L. J. 291, 292-303 (1996). Shifting legislative majorities could change the Constitution and effectively circumvent the difficult and detailed amendment process contained in Article V.\nWe now turn to consider whether RFRA can be considered enforcement legislation under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nB \nRespondent contends that RFRA is a proper exercise of Congress' remedial or preventive power. The Act, it is said, is a reasonable means of protecting the free exercise of religion as defined by  Smith.  It prevents and remedies laws which are enacted with the unconstitutional object of targeting religious beliefs and practices. See  Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.  v.  Hialeah,  508 U. S. 520 , 533 (1993) (\"[A] law targeting religious beliefs as such is never permissible\"). To avoid the difficulty of proving such violations, it is said, Congress can simply invalidate any law which imposes a substantial burden on a religious practice unless it is justified by a compelling interest and is the least restrictive means of accomplishing that interest. If Congress can prohibit laws with discriminatory effects in order to prevent racial discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, see  Fullilove  v.  Klutznick,  448 U. S. 448 , 477 (1980) (plurality opinion);  City of Rome,  446 U. S., at 177, then it can do the same, respondent argues, to promote religious liberty. 530 \nWhile preventive rules are sometimes appropriate remedial measures, there must be a congruence between the means used and the ends to be achieved. The appropriateness of remedial measures must be considered in light of the evil presented. See  South Carolina  v.  Katzenbach, 383  U. S., at 308. Strong measures appropriate to address one harm may be an unwarranted response to another, lesser one.  Id.,  at 334.\nA comparison between RFRA and the Voting Rights Act is instructive. In contrast to the record which confronted Congress and the Judiciary in the voting rights cases, RFRA's legislative record lacks examples of modern instances of generally applicable laws passed because of religious bigotry. The history of persecution in this country detailed in the hearings mentions no episodes occurring in the past 40 years. See,  e.  g., Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1991, Hearings on H. R. 2797 before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 2d Sess., 331-334 (1993) (statement of Douglas Laycock) (House Hearings); The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Hearing on S. 2969 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 2d Sess., 30-31 (1993) (statement of DaHin H. Oaks) (Senate Hearing); id., at 68-76 (statement of Douglas Laycock); Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1990, Hearing on H. R. 5377 before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 49 (1991) (statement of John H. Buchanan, Jr.) (1990 House Hearing). The absence of more recent episodes stems from the fact that, as one witness testified, \"deliberate persecution is not the usual problem in this country.\" House Hearings 334 (statement of Douglas Laycock). See also House Report 2 (\"[L]aws directly targeting religious practices have become increasingly rare\"). Rather, the emphasis of the hearings was on laws of general applicability which place incidental burdens on religion. Much of the discussion cen- 531 \ntered upon anecdotal evidence of autopsies performed on Jewish individuals and Hmong immigrants in violation of their religious beliefs, see,  e.  g., House Hearings 81 (statement of Nadine Strossen); id., at 107-110 (statement of William Yang); id., at 118 (statement of Rep. Stephen J. Solarz); id., at 336 (statement of Douglas Laycock); Senate Hearing 5-6, 14-26 (statement of William Yang); id., at 27-28 (statement of Hmong-Lao Unity Assn., Inc.); id., at 50 (statement of Baptist Joint Committee); see also Senate Report 8; House Report 5-6, and n. 14, and on zoning regulations and historic preservation laws (like the one at issue here), which, as an incident of their normal operation, have adverse effects on churches and synagogues. See,  e.  g., House Hearings 17, 57 (statement of Robert P. Dugan, Jr.); id., at 81 (statement of Nadine Strossen); id., at 122-123 (statement of Rep. Stephen J. Solarz); id., at 157 (statement of Edward M. Gaffney, Jr.); id., at 327 (statement of Douglas Laycock); Senate Hearing 143-144 (statement of Forest D. Montgomery); 1990 House Hearing 39 (statement of Robert P. Dugan, Jr.); see also Senate Report 8; House Report 5-6, and n. 14. It is difficult to maintain that they are examples of legislation enacted or enforced due to animus or hostility to the burdened religious practices or that they indicate some widespread pattern of religious discrimination in this country. Congress' concern was with the incidental burdens imposed, not the object or purpose of the legislation. See House Report 2; Senate Report 4-5; House Hearings 64 (statement of Nadine Strossen); id., at 117-118 (statement of Rep. Stephen J. Solarz); 1990 House Hearing 14 (statement of Rep. Stephen J. Solarz). This lack of support in the legislative record, however, is not RFRA's most serious shortcoming. Judicial deference, in most cases, is based not on the state of the legislative record Congress compiles but \"on due regard for the decision of the body constitutionally appointed to decide.\"  Oregon  v.  Mitchell,  400 U. S., at 207 (opinion of Harlan, J.). As a gen- 532 \neral matter, it is for Congress to determine the method by which it will reach a decision.\nRegardless of the state of the legislative record, RFRA cannot be considered remedial, preventive legislation, if those terms are to have any meaning. RFRA is so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior. It appears, instead, to attempt a substantive change in constitutional protections. Preventive measures prohibiting certain types of laws may be appropriate when there is reason to believe that many of the laws affected by the congressional enactment have a significant likelihood of being unconstitutional. See  City of Rome,  446 U. S., at 177 (since \"jurisdictions with a demonstrable history of intentional racial discrimination ... create the risk of purposeful discrimination,\" Congress could \"prohibit changes that have a discriminatory impact\" in those jurisdictions). Remedial legislation under § 5 \"should be adapted to the mischief and wrong which the [Fourteenth] [A]mendment was intended to provide against.\"  Civil Rights Cases,  109 U. S., at 13.\nRFRA is not so confined. Sweeping coverage ensures its intrusion at every level of government, displacing laws and prohibiting official actions of almost every description and regardless of subject matter. RFRA's restrictions apply to every agency and official of the Federal, State, and local Governments. 42 U. S. Ct. § 2000bb-2(1). RFRA applies to all federal and state law, statutory or otherwise, whether adopted before or after its enactment. § 2000bb-3(a). RFRA has no termination date or termination mechanism. Any law is subject to challenge at any time by any individual who alleges a substantial burden on his or her free exercise of religion.\nThe reach and scope of RFRA distinguish it from other measures passed under Congress' enforcement power, even in the area of voting rights. In  South Carolina  v.  Katzen bach, the challenged provisions were confined to those re- 533 \ngions of the country where voting discrimination had been most flagrant, see 383 U. S., at 315, and affected a discrete class of state laws, i.  e.,  state voting laws. Furthermore, to ensure that the reach of the Voting Rights Act was limited to those cases in which constitutional violations were most likely (in order to reduce the possibility of overbreadth), the coverage under the Act would terminate \"at the behest of States and political subdivisions in which the danger of substantial voting discrimination has not materialized during the preceding five years.\"  Id.,  at 331. The provisions restricting and banning literacy tests, upheld in  Katzenbach  v.  Morgan,  384 U. S. 641  (1966), and  Oregon  v.  Mitchell, supra,  attacked a particular type of voting qualification, one with a long history as a \"notorious means to deny and abridge voting rights on racial grounds.\"  South Carolina  v.  Katzenbach,  383 U. S., at 355 ( Black J., concurring and dissenting). In  City of Rome, supra,  the Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of a Voting Rights Act provision which required certain jurisdictions to submit changes in electoral practices to the Department of Justice for preimplementation review. The requirement was placed only on jurisdictions with a history of intentional racial discrimination in voting.  Id.,  at 177. Like the provisions at issue in  South Carolina  v.  Katzenbach,  this provision permitted a covered jurisdiction to avoid preclearance requirements under certain conditions and, moreover, lapsed in seven years. This is not to say, of course, that § 5 legislation requires termination dates, geographic restrictions, or egregious predicates. Where, however, a congressional enactment pervasively prohibits constitutional state action in an effort to remedy or to prevent unconstitutional state action, limitations of this kind tend to ensure Congress' means are proportionate to ends legitimate under § 5.\nThe stringent test RFRA demands of state laws reflects a lack of proportionality or congruence between the means adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved. If an objector can show a substantial burden on his free exercise, the 534 \nState must demonstrate a compelling governmental interest and show that the law is the least restrictive means of furthering its interest. Claims that a law substantially burdens someone's exercise of religion will often be difficult to contest. See  Smith,  494 U. S., at 887 (\"What principle of law or logic can be brought to bear to contradict a believer's assertion that a particular act is 'central' to his personal faith?\"); id., at 907 (\"The distinction between questions of centrality and questions of sincerity and burden is admittedly fine ... \") (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment). Requiring a State to demonstrate a compelling interest and show that it has adopted the least restrictive means of achieving that interest is the most demanding test known to constitutional law. If \" 'compelling interest' really means what it says ... , many laws will not meet the test .... [The test] would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind.\"  Id.,  at 888. Laws valid under  Smith  would fall under RFRA without regard to whether they had the object of stifling or punishing free exercise. We make these observations not to reargue the position of the majority in  Smith  but to illustrate the substantive alteration of its holding attempted by RFRA. Even assuming RFRA would be interpreted in effect to mandate some lesser test, say, one equivalent to intermediate scrutiny, the statute nevertheless would require searching judicial scrutiny of state law with the attendant likelihood of invalidation. This is a considerable congressional intrusion into the States' traditional prerogatives and general authority to regulate for the health and welfare of their citizens.\nThe substantial costs RFRA exacts, both in practical terms of imposing a heavy litigation burden on the States and in terms of curtailing their traditional general regulatory power, far exceed any pattern or practice of unconstitutional conduct under the Free Exercise Clause as interpreted in  Smith.  Simply put, RFRA is not designed to identify and counteract state laws likely to be unconstitutional because of 535 \ntheir treatment of religion. In most cases, the state laws to which RFRA applies are not ones which will have been motivated by religious bigotry. If a state law disproportionately burdened a particular class of religious observers, this circumstance might be evidence of an impermissible legislative motive. Cf.  Washington  v.  Davis,  426 U. S. 229 , 241 (1976). RFRA's substantial-burden test, however, is not even a discriminatory-effects or disparate-impact test. It is a reality of the modern regulatory state that numerous state laws, such as the zoning regulations at issue here, impose a substantial burden on a large class of individuals. When the exercise of religion has been burdened in an incidental way by a law of general application, it does not follow that the persons affected have been burdened any more than other citizens, let alone burdened because of their religious beliefs. In addition, the Act imposes in every case a least restrictive means requirement-a requirement that was not used in the  pre-Smith  jurisprudence RFRA purported to codify-which also indicates that the legislation is broader than is appropriate if the goal is to prevent and remedy constitutional violations.\nWhen Congress acts within its sphere of power and responsibilities, it has not just the right but the duty to make its own informed judgment on the meaning and force of the Constitution. This has been clear from the early days of the Republic. In 1789, when a Member of the House of Representatives objected to a debate on the constitutionality of legislation based on the theory that \"it would be officious\" to consider the constitutionality of a measure that did not affect the House, James Madison explained that \"it is incontrovertibly of as much importance to this branch of the Government as to any other, that the constitution should be preserved entire. It is our duty.\" 1 Annals of Congress 500 (1789). Were it otherwise, we would not afford Congress the presumption of validity its enactments now enjoy.\nOur national experience teaches that the Constitution is preserved best when each part of the Government respects 536 \nboth the Constitution and the proper actions and determinations of the other branches. When the Court has interpreted the Constitution, it has acted within the province of the Judicial Branch, which embraces the duty to say what the law is.  Marbury  v.  Madison,  1 Cranch at 177. When the political branches of the Government act against the background of a judicial interpretation of the Constitution already issued, it must be understood that in later cases and controversies the Court will treat its precedents with the respect due them under settled principles, including  stare decisis,  and contrary expectations must be disappointed. RFRA was designed to control cases and controversies, such as the one before us; but as the provisions of the federal statute here invoked are beyond congressional authority, it is this Court's precedent, not RFRA, which must control.\n***\nIt is for Congress in the first instance to \"determin[e] whether and what legislation is needed to secure the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment,\" and its conclusions are entitled to much deference.  Katzenbach  v.  Morgan, 384  U. S., at 651. Congress' discretion is not unlimited, however, and the courts retain the power, as they have since  Marbury  v.  Madison,  to determine if Congress has exceeded its authority under the Constitution. Broad as the power of Congress is under the Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, RFRA contradicts vital principles necessary to maintain separation of powers and the federal balance. The judgment of the Court of Appeals sustaining the Act's constitutionality is reversed.\nIt is so ordered.\n"}

For this inquiry we deem it necessary to reconsider the Court's holding in  Bowers. \nThere are broad statements of the substantive reach of liberty under the Due Process Clause in earlier cases, including  Pierce  v.  Society of Sisters,  268 U. S. 510  (1925), and  Meyer  v.  Nebraska,  262 U. S. 390  (1923); but the most pertinent beginning point is our decision in  Griswold  v.  Connecticut,  381 U. S. 479  (1965).\nIn  Griswold  the Court invalidated a state law prohibiting the use of drugs or devices of contraception and counseling or aiding and abetting the use of contraceptives. The Court described the protected interest as a right to privacy and 565 \nplaced emphasis on the marriage relation and the protected space of the marital bedroom.  Id.,  at 485.\nAfter  Griswold  it was established that the right to make certain decisions regarding sexual conduct extends beyond the marital relationship. In  Eisenstadt  v.  Baird,  405 U. S. 438  (1972), the Court invalidated a law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons. The case was decided under the Equal Protection Clause, id., at 454; but with respect to unmarried persons, the Court went on to state the fundamental proposition that the law impaired the exercise of their personal rights,  ibid.  It quoted from the statement of the Court of Appeals finding the law to be in conflict with fundamental human rights, and it followed with this statement of its own: \nThe opinions in  Griswold  and  Eisenstadt  were part of the background for the decision in  Roe  v.  Wade,  410 U. S. 113  (1973). As is well known, the case involved a challenge to the Texas law prohibiting abortions, but the laws of other States were affected as well. Although the Court held the woman's rights were not absolute, her right to elect an abortion did have real and substantial protection as an exercise of her liberty under the Due Process Clause. The Court cited cases that protect spatial freedom and cases that go well beyond it.  Roe  recognized the right of a woman to make certain fundamental decisions affecting her destiny and confirmed once more that the protection of liberty under the Due Process Clause has a substantive dimension of fundamental significance in defining the rights of the person. 566 \nIn  Carey  v.  Population Services Int'l,  431 U. S. 678  (1977), the Court confronted a New York law forbidding sale or distribution of contraceptive devices to persons under 16 years of age. Although there was no single opinion for the Court, the law was invalidated. Both  Eisenstadt  and  Carey,  as well as the holding and rationale in  Roe,  confirmed that the reasoning of  Griswold  could not be confined to the protection of rights of married adults. This was the state of the law with respect to some of the most relevant cases when the Court considered  Bowers  v.  Hardwick. \nThe facts in  Bowers  had some similarities to the instant case. A police officer, whose right to enter seems not to have been in question, observed Hardwick, in his own bedroom, engaging in intimate sexual conduct with another adult male. The conduct was in violation of a Georgia statute making it a criminal offense to engage in sodomy. One difference between the two cases is that the Georgia statute prohibited the conduct whether or not the participants were of the same sex, while the Texas statute, as we have seen, applies only to participants of the same sex. Hardwick was not prosecuted, but he brought an action in federal court to declare the state statute invalid. He alleged he was a practicing homosexual and that the criminal prohibition violated rights guaranteed to him by the Constitution. The Court, in an opinion by Justice White, sustained the Georgia law. Chief Justice Burger and Justice Powell joined the opinion of the Court and filed separate, concurring opinions. Four Justices dissented. 478 U. S., at 199 (opinion of Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and STEVENS, JJ.); id., at 214 (opinion of STEVENS, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ.).\nThe Court began its substantive discussion in  Bowers  as follows: \"The issue presented is whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy and hence invalidates the laws of the many States that still make such conduct illegal and have done so 567 \nfor a very long time.\"  Id.,  at 190. That statement, we now conclude, discloses the Court's own failure to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake. To say that the issue in  Bowers  was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the claim the individual put forward, just as it would demean a married couple were it to be said marriage is simply about the right to have sexual intercourse. The laws involved in  Bowers  and here are, to be sure, statutes that purport to do no more than prohibit a particular sexual act. Their penalties and purposes, though, have more farreaching consequences, touching upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home. The statutes do seek to control a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.\nThis, as a general rule, should counsel against attempts by the State, or a court, to define the meaning of the relationship or to set its boundaries absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the law protects. It suffices for us to acknowledge that adults may choose to enter upon this relationship in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons. When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring. The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to make this choice.\nHaving misapprehended the claim of liberty there presented to it, and thus stating the claim to be whether there is a fundamental right to engage in consensual sodomy, the  Bowers  Court said: \"Proscriptions against that conduct have ancient roots.\"  Id.,  at 192. In academic writings, and in many of the scholarly  amicus  briefs filed to assist the Court in this case, there are fundamental criticisms of the historical premises relied upon by the majority and concurring opin- 568 \nions in  Bowers.  Brief for Cato Institute as  Amicus Curiae  16-17; Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as  Amici Curiae  15-21; Brief for Professors of History et al. as  Amici Curiae  3-10. We need not enter this debate in the attempt to reach a definitive historical judgment, but the following considerations counsel against adopting the definitive conclusions upon which  Bowers  placed such reliance.\nAt the outset it should be noted that there is no longstanding history in this country of laws directed at homosexual conduct as a distinct matter. Beginning in colonial times there were prohibitions of sodomy derived from the English criminal laws passed in the first instance by the Reformation Parliament of 1533. The English prohibition was understood to include relations between men and women as well as relations between men and men. See,  e. g., King  v.  Wiseman,  92 Eng. Rep. 774, 775 (K. B. 1718) (interpreting \"mankind\" in Act of 1533 as including women and girls). Nineteenth-century commentators similarly read American sodomy, buggery, and crime-against-nature statutes as criminalizing certain relations between men and women and between men and men. See,  e.  g., 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law § 1028 (1858); 2 J. Chitty, Criminal Law 47-50 (5th Am. ed. 1847); R. De sty, A Compendium of American Criminal Law 143 (1882); J. May, The Law of Crimes § 203 (2d ed. 1893). The absence of legal prohibitions focusing on homosexual conduct may be explained in part by noting that according to some scholars the concept of the homosexual as a distinct category of person did not emerge until the late 19th century. See,  e.  g., J. Katz, The Invention of Heterosexuality 10 (1995); J. D'Emilio & E. Freedman, Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America 121 (2d ed. 1997) (\"The modern terms  homosexuality  and  heterosexuality  do not apply to an era that had not yet articulated these distinctions\"). Thus early American sodomy laws were not directed at homosexuals as such but instead sought to prohibit nonprocreative sexual activity more generally. This does not suggest approval of 569 \nhomosexual conduct. It does tend to show that this particular form of conduct was not thought of as a separate category from like conduct between heterosexual persons.\nLaws prohibiting sodomy do not seem to have been enforced against consenting adults acting in private. A substantial number of sodomy prosecutions and convictions for which there are surviving records were for predatory acts against those who could not or did not consent, as in the case of a minor or the victim of an assault. As to these, one purpose for the prohibitions was to ensure there would be no lack of coverage if a predator committed a sexual assault that did not constitute rape as defined by the criminal law. Thus the model sodomy indictments presented in a 19th-century treatise, see 2 Chitty,  supra,  at 49, addressed the predatory acts of an adult man against a minor girl or minor boy. Instead of targeting relations between consenting adults in private, 19th-century sodomy prosecutions typically involved relations between men and minor girls or minor boys, relations between adults involving force, relations between adults implicating disparity in status, or relations between men and animals.\nTo the extent that there were any prosecutions for the acts in question, 19th-century evidence rules imposed a burden that would make a conviction more difficult to obtain even taking into account the problems always inherent in prosecuting consensual acts committed in private. Under then-prevailing standards, a man could not be convicted of sodomy based upon testimony of a consenting partner, because the partner was considered an accomplice. A partner's testimony, however, was admissible if he or she had not consented to the act or was a minor, and therefore incapable of consent. See,  e.  g., F. Wharton, Criminal Law 443 (2d ed. 1852); 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law 512 (8th ed. 1880). The rule may explain in part the infrequency of these prosecutions. In all events that infrequency makes it difficult to say that society approved of a rigorous and systematic 570 \npunishment of the consensual acts committed in private and by adults. The longstanding criminal prohibition of homosexual sodomy upon which the  Bowers  decision placed such reliance is as consistent with a general condemnation of nonprocreative sex as it is with an established tradition of prosecuting acts because of their homosexual character.\nThe policy of punishing consenting adults for private acts was not much discussed in the early legal literature. We can infer that one reason for this was the very private nature of the conduct. Despite the absence of prosecutions, there may have been periods in which there was public criticism of homosexuals as such and an insistence that the criminal laws be enforced to discourage their practices. But far from possessing \"ancient roots,\"  Bowers,  478 U. S., at 192, American laws targeting same-sex couples did not develop until the last third of the 20th century. The reported decisions concerning the prosecution of consensual, homosexual sodomy between adults for the years 1880-1995 are not always clear in the details, but a significant number involved conduct in a public place. See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as  Amici Curiae  14-15, and n. 18.\nIt was not until the 1970's that any State singled out same-sex relations for criminal prosecution, and only nine States have done so. See 1977 Ark. Gen. Acts no. 828; 1983 Kan. Sess. Laws p. 652; 1974 Ky. Acts p. 847; 1977 Mo. Laws p. 687; 1973 Mont. Laws p. 1339; 1977 Nev. Stats. p. 1632; 1989 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 591; 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 399; see also  Post  v.  State,  715 P. 2d 1105 (Okla. Crim. App. 1986) (sodomy law invalidated as applied to different-sex couples).  Post-Bowers  even some of these States did not adhere to the policy of suppressing homosexual conduct. Over the course of the last decades, States with same-sex prohibitions have moved toward abolishing them. See,  e. g., Jegley  v.  Picado,  349 Ark. 600, 80 S. W. 3d 332 (2002);  Gryczan  v.  State, 283  Mont. 433, 942 P. 2d 112 (1997);  Campbell  v.  Sundquist, 926  S. W. 2d 250 (Tenn. App. 1996);  Commonwealth  v.  Wasson, 571 \n842 S. W. 2d 487 (Ky. 1992); see also 1993 Nev. Stats. p. 518 (repealing Nev. Rev. Stat. § 201.193).\nIn summary, the historical grounds relied upon in  Bowers  are more complex than the majority opinion and the concurring opinion by Chief Justice Burger indicate. Their historical premises are not without doubt and, at the very least, are overstated.\nIt must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in  Bowers  was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral. The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family. For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives. These considerations do not answer the question before us, however. The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law. \"Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.\"  Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.  v.  Casey,  505 U. S. 833 , 850 (1992).\nChief Justice Burger joined the opinion for the Court in  Bowers  and further explained his views as follows: \"Decisions of individuals relating to homosexual conduct have been subject to state intervention throughout the history of Western civilization. Condemnation of those practices is firmly rooted in Judeao-Christian moral and ethical standards.\" 478 U. S., at 196. As with Justice White's assumptions about history, scholarship casts some doubt on the sweeping nature of the statement by Chief Justice Burger as it pertains to private homosexual conduct between consenting adults. See,  e.  g., Eskridge, Hardwick and Historiography, 1999 U. Ill. L. Rev. 631, 656. In all events we think that our laws and traditions in the past half century are of 572 \nmost relevance here. These references show an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex. \"[H]istory and tradition are the starting point but not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry.\"  County of Sacramento \nThis emerging recognition should have been apparent when  Bowers  was decided. In 1955 the American Law Institute promulgated the Model Penal Code and made clear that it did not recommend or provide for \"criminal penalties for consensual sexual relations conducted in private.\" ALl, Model Penal Code § 213.2, Comment 2, p. 372 (1980). It justified its decision on three grounds: (1) The prohibitions undermined respect for the law by penalizing conduct many people engaged in; (2) the statutes regulated private conduct not harmful to others; and (3) the laws were arbitrarily enforced and thus invited the danger of blackmail. ALl, Model Penal Code, Commentary 277-280 (Tent. Draft No.4, 1955). In 1961 Illinois changed its laws to conform to the Model Penal Code. Other States soon followed. Brief for Cato Institute as  Amicus Curiae 15-16. \nIn  Bowers  the Court referred to the fact that before 1961 all 50 States had outlawed sodomy, and that at the time of the Court's decision 24 States and the District of Columbia had sodomy laws. 478 U. S., at 192-193. Justice Powell pointed out that these prohibitions often were being ignored, however. Georgia, for instance, had not sought to enforce its law for decades.  Id.,  at 197-198, n. 2 (\"The history of nonenforcement suggests the moribund character today of laws criminalizing this type of private, consensual conduct\").\nThe sweeping references by Chief Justice Burger to the history of Western civilization and to Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards did not take account of other authorities pointing in an opposite direction. A committee advising the British Parliament recommended in 1957 repeal of laws 573 \npunishing homosexual conduct. The Wolfenden Report: Report of the Committee on Homosexual Offenses and Prostitution (1963). Parliament enacted the substance of those recommendations 10 years later. Sexual Offences Act 1967, § 1.\nOf even more importance, almost five years before  Bowers  was decided the European Court of Human Rights considered a case with parallels to  Bowers  and to today's case. An adult male resident in Northern Ireland alleged he was a practicing homosexual who desired to engage in consensual homosexual conduct. The laws of Northern Ireland forbade him that right. He alleged that he had been questioned, his home had been searched, and he feared criminal prosecution. The court held that the laws proscribing the conduct were invalid under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Dudgeon  v.  United Kingdom,  45 Eur. Ct. H. R. (1981) ~ 52. Authoritative in all countries that are members of the Council of Europe (21 nations then, 45 nations now), the decision is at odds with the premise in  Bowers  that the claim put forward was insubstantial in our Western civilization.\nIn our own constitutional system the deficiencies in  Bowers  became even more apparent in the years following its announcement. The 25 States with laws prohibiting the relevant conduct referenced in the  Bowers  decision are reduced now to 13, of which 4 enforce their laws only against homosexual conduct. In those States where sodomy is still proscribed, whether for same-sex or heterosexual conduct, there is a pattern of nonenforcement with respect to consenting adults acting in private. The State of Texas admitted in 1994 that as of that date it had not prosecuted anyone under those circumstances.  State  v.  Morales,  869 S. W. 2d 941,943.\nTwo principal cases decided after  Bowers  cast its holding into even more doubt. In  Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.  v.  Casey,  505 U. S. 833  (1992), the Court reaffirmed the substantive force of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. The  Casey  decision again confirmed 574 \nthat our laws and tradition afford constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education.  Id.,  at 851. In explaining the respect the Constitution demands for the autonomy of the person in making these choices, we stated as follows: \n\"These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.\"  Ibid. \nPersons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do. The decision in  Bowers  would deny them this right.\nThe second  post-Bowers  case of principal relevance is  Romer  v.  Evans,  517 U. S. 620  (1996). There the Court struck down class-based legislation directed at homosexuals as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  Romer  invalidated an amendment to Colorado's Constitution which named as a solitary class persons who were homosexuals, lesbians, or bisexual either by \"orientation, conduct, practices or relationships,\" id., at 624 (internal quotation marks omitted), and deprived them of protection under state antidiscrimination laws. We concluded that the provision was \"born of animosity toward the class of persons affected\" and further that it had no rational relation to a legitimate governmental purpose.  Id.,  at 634.\nAs an alternative argument in this case, counsel for the petitioners and some  amici  contend that  Romer  provides the basis for declaring the Texas statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause. That is a tenable argument, but we con- 575 \nclude the instant case requires us to address whether  Bowers  itself has continuing validity. Were we to hold the statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause some might question whether a prohibition would be valid if drawn differently, say, to prohibit the conduct both between same-sex and different-sex participants.\nEquality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect for conduct protected by the substantive guarantee of liberty are linked in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both interests. If protected conduct is made criminal and the law which does so remains unexamined for its substantive validity, its stigma might remain even if it were not enforceable as drawn for equal protection reasons. When homosexual conduct is made criminal by the law of the State, that declaration in and of itself is an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres. The central holding of  Bowers  has been brought in question by this case, and it should be addressed. Its continuance as precedent demeans the lives of homosexual persons.\nThe stigma this criminal statute imposes, moreover, is not trivial. The offense, to be sure, is but a class C misdemeanor, a minor offense in the Texas legal system. Still, it remains a criminal offense with all that imports for the dignity of the persons charged. The petitioners will bear on their record the history of their criminal convictions. Just this Term we rejected various challenges to state laws requiring the registration of sex offenders.  Smith  v.  Doe, 538  U. S. 84 (2003);  Connecticut Dept. of Public Safety  v.  Doe,  538 U. S. 1  (2003). We are advised that if Texas convicted an adult for private, consensual homosexual conduct under the statute here in question the convicted person would come within the registration laws of at least four States were he or she to be subject to their jurisdiction. Pet. for Cert. 13, and n. 12 (citing Idaho Code §§ 18-8301 to 18-8326 (Cum. Supp. 2002); La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. §§ 15:540-15:549 576 \n(West 2003); Miss. Code Ann. §§ 45-33-21 to 45-33-57 (Lexis 2003); S. Ct. Code Ann. §§ 23-3-400 to 23-3-490 (West 2002)). This underscores the consequential nature of the punishment and the state-sponsored condemnation attendant to the criminal prohibition. Furthermore, the Texas criminal conviction carries with it the other collateral consequences always following a conviction, such as notations on job application forms, to mention but one example.\nThe foundations of  Bowers  have sustained serious erosion from our recent decisions in  Casey  and  Romer.  When our precedent has been thus weakened, criticism from other sources is of greater significance. In the United States criticism of  Bowers  has been substantial and continuing, disapproving of its reasoning in all respects, not just as to its historical assumptions. See,  e.  g., C. Fried, Order and Law:\nArguing the Reagan Revolution-A Firsthand Account 81-84 (1991); R. Posner, Sex and Reason 341-350 (1992). The courts of five different States have declined to follow it in interpreting provisions in their own state constitutions parallel to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, see  Jegley  v.  Picado,  349 Ark. 600, 80 S. W. 3d 332  (2002); Powell  v.  State,  270 Ga. 327, 510 S. E. 2d 18, 24 (1998);  Gryczan  v.  State,  283 Mont. 433, 942 P. 2d 112 (1997);  Campbell  v.  Sundquist,  926 S. W. 2d 250 (Tenn. App. 1996);  Commonwealth  v.  Wasson,  842 S. W. 2d 487 (Ky. 1992).\nTo the extent  Bowers  relied on values we share with a wider civilization, it should be noted that the reasoning and holding in  Bowers  have been rejected elsewhere. The European Court of Human Rights has followed not  Bowers  but its own decision in  Dudgeon  v.  United Kingdom.  See  P.  G. & J.  H.  v.  United Kingdom,  App. No. 00044787/98, ~ 56 (Eur. Ct. H. R., Sept. 25, 2001);  Modinos  v.  Cyprus,  259 Eur. Ct. H. R. (1993);  Norris  v.  Ireland,  142 Eur. Ct. H. R. (1988). Other nations, too, have taken action consistent with an affirmation of the protected right of homosexual adults to engage in intimate, consensual conduct. See Brief for Mary 577 \nRobinson et al. as  Amici Curiae  11-12. The right the petitioners seek in this case has been accepted as an integral part of human freedom in many other countries. There has been no showing that in this country the governmental interest in circumscribing personal choice is somehow more legitimate or urgent.\nThe doctrine of  stare decisis  is essential to the respect accorded to the judgments of the Court and to the stability of the law. It is not, however, an inexorable command.  Payne  v.  Tennessee,  501 U. S. 808 , 828 (1991)  (\"Stare decisis  is not an inexorable command; rather, it 'is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision'\" (quoting  Helvering  v.  Hallock,  309 U. S. 106 , 119 (1940))). In  Casey  we noted that when a court is asked to overrule a precedent recognizing a constitutional liberty interest, individual or societal reliance on the existence of that liberty cautions with particular strength against reversing course. 505 U. S., at 855-856; see also id., at 844 (\"Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt\"). The holding in  Bowers,  however, has not induced detrimental reliance comparable to some instances where recognized individual rights are involved. Indeed, there has been no individual or societal reliance on  Bowers  of the sort that could counsel against overturning its holding once there are compelling reasons to do so.  Bowers  itself causes uncertainty, for the precedents before and after its issuance contradict its central holding.\nThe rationale of  Bowers  does not withstand careful analysis. In his dissenting opinion in  Bowers  JUSTICE STEVENS came to these conclusions: \n\"Our prior cases make two propositions abundantly clear. First, the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice; neither history nor tradition could save a law prohibiting miscegenation from consti- 578 \ntutional attack. Second, individual decisions by married persons, concerning the intimacies of their physical relationship, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of 'liberty' protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, this protection extends to intimate choices by unmarried as well as married persons.\" 478 U. S., at 216 (footnotes and citations omitted). \nJUSTICE STEVENS' analysis, in our view, should have been controlling in  Bowers  and should control here.\n Bowers  was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today. It ought not to remain binding precedent.  Bowers  v.  Hardwick  should be and now is overruled.\nThe present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution. It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter. The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. \"It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.\"  Casey, supra,  at 847. The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.\nHad those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific. They did not presume 579 \nto have this insight. They knew times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n"}

The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, construing his complaint as seeking the right to render a firearm operable and carry it about his home in that condition only when necessary for self-defense,2  reversed, see Parker v. District of Columbia, 375 U.S. App. D.C. 140, 478 F.3d 370, 401 (2007).  It held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess firearms and that the city's total ban on handguns, as well as its requirement that firearms in the home be kept nonfunctional even when necessary for self-defense, violated that right.  See id., at 395, 399-401.  The Court of Appeals directed the District Court to enter summary judgment for respondent. \nWe granted certiorari. 552 U.S. 1035, 128 S. Ct. 645, 169 L. Ed. 2d 417 (2007). \nII \nWe turn first to the meaning of the Second Amendment. \nA \nHN1[] LEdHN[1][] [1]  The Second Amendment provides:  \"A well  [****8] regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"  In interpreting this text, we are guided by the principle that \"[t]he Constitution was written to be understood by the voters; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as distinguished from technical meaning.\"  United States v. Sprague, 282 U.S. 716, 731, 51 S. Ct. 220, 75 L. Ed. 640 (1931); see also Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. 1, 9 Wheat. 1, 188, 6 L. Ed. 23 (1824).  Normal meaning may of  [*577]  course include an idiomatic meaning, but it excludes secret or technical meanings that would not have been known to ordinary citizens in the founding generation. \n [**2789] The two sides in this case have set out very different interpretations of the Amendment.  Petitioners and today's dissenting Justices believe that it protects only the right to possess and carry a firearm in connection with militia service.  See Brief for Petitioners 11-12; post, at 636-637, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 684 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Respondent argues that it protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.  See Brief for Respondent  [****9] 2-4. \nHN2[] LEdHN[2][] [2]  The Second Amendment is naturally divided into two parts:  its prefatory clause and its operative clause.  The former does not limit the latter grammatically, but rather announces a purpose.  The Amendment could be rephrased, \"Because a well regulated Militia is necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\"  See J. Tiffany, A Treatise on Government and Constitutional Law § 585, p 394 (1867); Brief for Professors of Linguistics and English as Amici Curiae 3 (hereinafter Linguists'  [***649] Brief).  Although this structure of the Second Amendment is unique in our Constitution, other legal documents of the founding era, particularly individual-rights provisions of state constitutions, commonly included a prefatory statement of purpose.  See generally Volokh, The Commonplace Second Amendment, 73 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 793, 814-821 (1998). \nLogic demands that there be a link between the stated purpose and the command.  The Second Amendment would be nonsensical if it read, \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to petition for redress of grievances shall not be infringed.\"  That requirement  [****10] of logical connection may cause a prefatory clause to resolve an ambiguity in the operative clause. (\"The  [*578]  separation of church and state being an important objective, the teachings of canons shall have no place in our jurisprudence.\"  The preface makes clear that the operative clause refers not to canons of interpretation but to clergymen.)  But apart from that clarifying function, a prefatory clause does not limit or expand the scope of the operative clause.  See F. Dwarris, A General Treatise on Statutes 268-269 (P. Potter ed. 1871); T. Sedgwick, The Interpretation and Construction of Statutory and Constitutional Law 42-45 (2d ed. 1874).3   \"'It is nothing unusual in acts . . . for the enacting part to go beyond the preamble; the remedy often extends beyond the particular act or mischief which first suggested the necessity of the law.'\"  J. Bishop, Commentaries on Written Laws and Their Interpretation § 51, p 49 (1882) (quoting Rex v. Marks, 3 East 157, 165, 102 Eng. Rep. 557, 560 (K. B. 1802)).  Therefore, while we will begin [**2790]  our textual analysis with the operative clause, we will return to the prefatory clause to ensure that our reading of the operative clause is consistent with the announced  [****11] purpose.4 \n [*579]  1. Operative Clause.\na. \"Right of the People.\"  The first salient feature of the operative clause is that it codifies a \"right of the  [***650] people.\"  The unamended Constitution and the Bill of Rights use the phrase \"right of the people\" two other times, in the First Amendment's Assembly-and-Petition Clause and in the Fourth Amendment's Search-and-Seizure Clause.  The Ninth Amendment uses very similar terminology (\"The enumeration in the Constitution,  [****13] of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people\").  All three of these instances unambiguously refer to individual rights, not \"collective\" rights, or rights that may be exercised only through participation in some corporate body.5 \nThree provisions of the Constitution refer to \"the people\" in a context other than \"rights\"--the famous preamble (\"We the people\"), § 2 of Article I (providing that \"the people\" will choose members of the House), and the Tenth Amendment (providing that those powers not given the Federal Government remain with \"the States\" or \"the people\").  Those provisions arguably refer to \"the people\" acting collectively--but  [*580]   [****14] they deal with the exercise or reservation of powers, not rights.  Nowhere else in the Constitution does a \"right\" attributed to \"the people\" refer to anything other than an individual right.6 \nWhat  [****15] is more, in all six other provisions of the Constitution that mention \"the people,\" the term unambiguously refers to all members of the political community, not [**2791]  an unspecified subset.  As we said in United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 265, 110 S. Ct. 1056, 108 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1990): \nHN4[] LEdHN[4][] [4] \"'[T]he people' seems to have been a term of art employed in select parts of the Constitution. . . .  [Its uses] sugges[t] that 'the people' protected by the Fourth Amendment, and by the First and Second Amendments, and to whom rights and powers are reserved in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community.\"\nThis contrasts markedly with the phrase \"the militia\" in the prefatory clause.  As we will describe below, the \"militia\" in colonial America consisted of a subset of \"the people\"--those who were male, able bodied, and within a  [***651] certain age range.  Reading the Second Amendment as protecting only the right  [*581]  to \"keep and bear Arms\" in an organized militia therefore fits poorly with the operative clause's description of the holder of that right as \"the people.\" \nWe start therefore  [****16] with a strong presumption that the Second Amendment right is exercised individually and belongs to all Americans. \nb. \"Keep and Bear Arms.\"  We move now from the holder of the right--\"the people\"--to the substance of the right:  \"to keep and bear Arms.\" \nBefore addressing the verbs \"keep\" and \"bear,\" we interpret their object:  \"Arms.\"  HN5[] LEdHN[5][] [5] The 18th-century meaning is no different from the meaning today.  The 1773 edition of Samuel Johnson's dictionary defined \"arms\" as \"[w]eapons of offence, or armour of defence.\"  1 Dictionary of the English Language 106 (4th ed.) (reprinted 1978) (hereinafter Johnson).  Timothy Cunningham's important 1771 legal dictionary defined \"arms\" as \"any thing that a man wears for his defence, or takes into his hands, or useth in wrath to cast at or strike another.\"  1 A New and Complete Law Dictionary; see also N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (reprinted 1989) (hereinafter Webster) (similar). \nThe term was applied, then as now, to weapons that were not specifically designed for military use and were not employed in a military capacity.  For instance, Cunningham's legal dictionary gave as an example of usage:  \"Servants and labourers shall use bows and arrows  [****17] on Sundays, &c. and not bear other arms.\"  See also, e.g., An Act for the trial of Negroes, 1797 Del. Laws ch. XLIII, § 6, in 1 First Laws of the State of Delaware 102, 104 (J. Cushing ed. 1981 (pt. 1)); see generally State v. Duke, 42 Tex. 455, 458 (1874) (citing decisions of state courts construing \"arms\").  Although one founding-era thesaurus limited \"arms\" (as opposed to \"weapons\") to \"instruments of offence generally made use of in war,\" even that source stated that all firearms constituted \"arms.\"  1 J. Trusler, The Distinction Between Words Esteemed  [*582]  Synonymous in the English Language 37 (3d ed. 1794) (emphasis added). \nSome have made the argument, bordering on the frivolous, HN6[] LEdHN[6][] [6] that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the Second Amendment.  We do not interpret constitutional rights that way.  Just as the First Amendment protects modern forms of communications, e.g., Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 849, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 138 L. Ed. 2d 874 (1997), and the Fourth Amendment applies to modern forms of search, e.g., Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 35-36, 121 S. Ct. 2038, 150 L. Ed. 2d 94 (2001), the Second Amendment extends, [**2792]  prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were  [****18] not in existence at the time of the founding. \nWe turn to the phrases \"keep arms\" and \"bear arms.\" Johnson defined \"keep\" as, most relevantly, \"[t]o retain; not to lose,\" and \"[t]o have in custody.\" Johnson 1095.  Webster defined it as \"[t]o hold; to retain in one's power or possession.\"  No party has apprised us of an idiomatic meaning of \"keep Arms.\"  Thus, HN7[] LEdHN[7][] [7] the most natural reading of \"keep Arms\" in the Second Amendment is to \"have weapons.\" \nThe phrase \"keep arms\" was not prevalent in the written documents of  [***652] the founding period that we have found, but there are a few examples, all of which favor viewing the right to \"keep Arms\" as an individual right unconnected with militia service.  William Blackstone, for example, wrote that Catholics convicted of not attending service in the Church of England suffered certain penalties, one of which was that they were not permitted to \"keep arms in their houses.\"  4 Commentaries on the Laws of England 55 (1769) (hereinafter Blackstone); see also 1 W. & M., ch. 15, § 4, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 422 (1689) (\"[N]o Papist . . . shall or may have or keep in his House . . . any Arms . . .\"); 1 W. Hawkins, Treatise on the Pleas of the Crown 26 (1771) (similar).   [****19] Petitioners point to militia laws of the founding period that required militia members to \"keep\" arms in connection with  [*583]  militia service, and they conclude from this that the phrase \"keep Arms\" has a militia-related connotation.  See Brief for Petitioners 16-17 (citing laws of Delaware, New Jersey, and Virginia).  This is rather like saying that, since there are many statutes that authorize aggrieved employees to \"file complaints\" with federal agencies, the phrase \"file complaints\" has an employment-related connotation.  \"Keep arms\" was simply a common way of referring to possessing arms, for militiamen and everyone else.7 \n [*584]  LEdHN[8][] [8] [**2793]   HN8[] At the time of the founding, as now, to \"bear\" meant to \"carry.\"  See Johnson 161; Webster; T. Sheridan, A Complete Dictionary of the English Language (1796); 2 Oxford English Dictionary 20 (2d ed. 1989) (hereinafter Oxford).  When used with \"arms,\" however, the term has a meaning that refers to carrying for a particular purpose--confrontation.  In Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 118 S. Ct. 1911, 141 L. Ed. 2d 111 (1998), in the course of analyzing the meaning of \"carries a firearm\" in a federal criminal statute, Justice Ginsburg  [***653] wrote that \"[s]urely  [****22] a most familiar meaning is, as the Constitution's Second Amendment . . . indicate[s]:  'wear, bear, or carry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.'\"  Id., at 143, 118 S. Ct. 1911, 141 L. Ed. 2d 111 (dissenting opinion) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990)).  We think that Justice Ginsburg accurately captured the natural meaning of \"bear arms.\"  Although the phrase implies that the carrying of the weapon is for the purpose of \"offensive or defensive action,\" it in no way connotes participation in a structured military organization. \nFrom our review of founding-era sources, we conclude that this natural meaning was also the meaning that \"bear arms\" had in the 18th century.  In numerous instances, \"bear arms\" was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia.  The most prominent examples are those most relevant to the Second Amendment:  nine state constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or the first two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens to \"bear arms in defense of themselves and the state\" or \"bear  [****23] arms in defense of himself and  [*585]  the state.\"8   It is clear from those formulations that \"bear arms\" did not refer only to carrying a weapon in an organized military unit.  Justice James Wilson interpreted the Pennsylvania Constitution's arms-bearing right, for example, as a recognition of the natural right of defense \"of one's person or house\"--what he called the law of \"self preservation.\"  2 Collected Works of James Wilson 1142, and n x (K. Hall & M. Hall eds. 2007) (citing Pa. Const., Art. IX, § 21 (1790)); see also T. Walker, Introduction to American Law 198 (1837) [**2794]  (\"Thus the right of self-defence [is] guaranteed by the [Ohio] constitution\"); see also id., at 157 (equating Second Amendment with that provision of the Ohio Constitution).  That was also the interpretation of those state constitutional provisions adopted by pre-Civil War state courts.9   These provisions  [*586]  demonstrate--again, in the most analogous linguistic context--that \"bear arms\"  [***654] was not limited to the carrying of arms in a militia. \nHN9[] LEdHN[9][] [9]  The phrase \"bear Arms\" also had at the time of the founding an idiomatic meaning that was significantly different from its natural meaning:  \"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight\" or \"to wage war.\"  See Linguists' Brief 18; post, at 646, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 690 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  But it unequivocally bore that idiomatic meaning only when followed by the preposition \"against,\" which was in turn followed by the target of the hostilities.  See 2 Oxford 21.  (That is how, for example, our Declaration of Independence P 28 used the phrase:  \"He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country . . . .\") Every example given by petitioners'  [****26] amici for the idiomatic meaning of \"bear arms\" from the founding period either includes the preposition \"against\" or is not clearly idiomatic.  See Linguists' Brief 18-23.  Without the preposition, \"bear arms\" normally meant (as it continues to mean today) what Justice Ginsburg's opinion in Muscarello said. \nIn any event, the meaning of \"bear arms\" that petitioners and Justice Stevens propose is not even the (sometimes) idiomatic meaning.  Rather, they manufacture a hybrid definition, whereby \"bear arms\" connotes the actual carrying of arms (and therefore is not really an idiom) but only in the service of an organized militia.  No dictionary has ever adopted that definition, and we have been apprised of no source that indicates that it carried that meaning at the time of the founding.  But it is easy to see why petitioners and the dissent are driven to the hybrid definition.  Giving \"bear Arms\" its idiomatic meaning would cause the protected right to consist of the right to be a soldier or to wage war--an absurdity that no commentator has ever endorsed.  See L. Levy, Origins of the Bill of Rights 135 (1999).  Worse still,  [*587]  the phrase \"keep and bear Arms\" would be incoherent.  The word \"Arms\" would  [****27] have two different meanings at once:  \"weapons\" (as the object of \"keep\") and (as the object of \"bear\") one-half of an idiom.  It would be rather like saying \"He filled and kicked the bucket\" to mean \"He filled the bucket and died.\"  Grotesque. \nPetitioners justify their limitation of \"bear arms\" to the military context by pointing out the unremarkable fact that it was often used in that context--the same mistake they made with respect to \"keep arms.\"  It is especially unremarkable that the phrase was often used in a military context in the federal legal sources (such as records of congressional debate) that have been the focus of petitioners' inquiry.  Those sources would have had little occasion to use it except in discussions about the standing army and the militia.  And the phrases used primarily in those military discussions include not only \"bear arms\" but also \"carry arms,\" \"possess arms,\" and \"have arms\"--though no one [**2795]  thinks that those other phrases also had special military meanings.  See Barnett, Was the Right to Keep and Bear Arms Conditioned on Service in an Organized Militia? 83 Texas L. Rev. 237, 261 (2004).  The common references to those \"fit to bear arms\" in congressional discussions  [****28] about the militia are matched by use of the same phrase in the few nonmilitary federal contexts where the concept would be relevant.  See, e.g., 30 Journals of Continental Congress 349-351 (J. Fitzpatrick  [***655] ed. 1934).  Other legal sources frequently used \"bear arms\" in nonmilitary contexts.10   Cunningham's legal dictionary, cited  [*588]  above, gave as an example of its usage a sentence unrelated to military affairs (\"Servants and labourers shall use bows and arrows on Sundays, &c. and not bear other arms\").  And if one looks beyond legal sources, \"bear arms\" was frequently used in nonmilitary contexts.  See Cramer & Olson, What Did \"Bear Arms\" Mean in the Second Amendment? 6 Georgetown J. L. & Pub. Pol'y 511 (2008) (identifying numerous nonmilitary uses of \"bear arms\" from the founding period). \nJustice Stevens points to a study by amici supposedly showing that the phrase \"bear arms\" was most frequently used in the military context.  See post, at 647-648, n. 9, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 691; Linguists' Brief 24.  Of course, as we have said, the fact that the phrase was commonly used in a particular context does not show that it is limited to that context, and, in any event, we have given many sources where the phrase was used in nonmilitary contexts.  Moreover, the study's collection appears to include (who knows how many times) the idiomatic phrase \"bear arms against,\" which is irrelevant.  The amici also dismiss examples such as \"'bear arms . . . for the purpose of killing game'\" because those uses are \"expressly  [*589]  qualified.\"  Linguists' Brief 24.  (Justice Stevens uses the same excuse for dismissing the state constitutional provisions analogous to the Second Amendment that identify private-use purposes  [****31] for which the individual right can be asserted.  See post, at 647, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 690-691.)  That analysis is faulty.  A purposive qualifying phrase that contradicts the word or phrase it modifies is unknown this side of the looking glass [**2796]  (except, apparently, in some courses on linguistics).  If \"bear arms\" means, as we think, simply the carrying of arms, a modifier can limit the purpose of the carriage (\"for the purpose of self-defense\" or \"to make war against the King\").  But if \"bear arms\" means, as the petitioners and the dissent think, the carrying of arms only for military purposes, one simply cannot add \"for  [***656] the purpose of killing game.\"  The right \"to carry arms in the militia for the purpose of killing game\" is worthy of the Mad Hatter.  Thus, these purposive qualifying phrases positively establish that \"to bear arms\" is not limited to military use.11 \nJustice Stevens places great weight on James Madison's inclusion of a conscientious-objector clause in his original draft of the Second Amendment:  \"but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms, shall be compelled to render military service in person.\"  Creating the Bill of Rights 12 (H. Veit, K. Bowling, & C. Bickford eds. 1991) (hereinafter Veit).  He argues that this clause establishes that the drafters of the Second Amendment intended \"bear Arms\" to refer only  [*590]  to military service.  See post, at 660-661, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 698.  It is always perilous to derive the meaning of an adopted provision from another provision deleted in the drafting process.12   In any case, what Justice Stevens would conclude from the deleted provision does not follow.  It was not meant to exempt from military service those who objected to going to war but had no scruples about  [****33] personal gunfights.  Quakers opposed the use of arms not just for militia service, but for any violent purpose whatsoever--so much so that Quaker frontiersmen were forbidden to use arms to defend their families, even though \"[i]n such circumstances the temptation to seize a hunting rifle or knife in self-defense . . . must sometimes have been almost overwhelming.\"  P. Brock, Pacifism in the United States 359 (1968); see M. Hirst, The Quakers in Peace and War 336-339 (1923); 3 T. Clarkson, Portraiture of Quakerism 103-104 (3d ed. 1807).  The Pennsylvania Militia Act of 1757 exempted from service those \"scrupling the use of arms\"--a phrase that no one contends had an idiomatic meaning.  See 5 Stat. at Large of Pa. 613 (J. Mitchell & H. Flanders Comm'r. 1898) (emphasis in original).  Thus, the most natural interpretation of Madison's deleted text is that those opposed to carrying weapons for potential violent confrontation would not be \"compelled to render military service,\" in which such carrying would be required. 13 \n [*591]   [***657]   [**2797] Finally, Justice Stevens suggests that \"keep and bear Arms\" was some sort of term of art, presumably akin to \"hue and cry\" or \"cease and desist.\"  (This suggestion usefully  [****35] evades the problem that there is no evidence whatsoever to support a military reading of \"keep arms.\")  Justice Stevens believes that the unitary meaning of \"keep and bear Arms\" is established by the Second Amendment's calling it a \"right\" (singular) rather than \"rights\" (plural).  See post, at 651, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 692-693.  There is nothing to this.  State constitutions of the founding period routinely grouped multiple (related) guarantees under a singular \"right,\" and the First Amendment protects the \"right [singular] of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"  See, e.g., Pa. Declaration of Rights §§ IX, XII, XVI, in 5 Thorpe 3083-3084; Ohio Const., Art. VIII, §§ 11, 19 (1802), in id., at 2910-2911.14   And even if \"keep and bear Arms\" were a unitary phrase, we find no evidence that it bore a military meaning.  Although the phrase was not at all common (which would be unusual for a term of art), we have found instances of its use with a clearly nonmilitary connotation.  In a 1780 debate in the House of Lords, for example, Lord Richmond described an order to disarm private  [*592]  citizens (not militia members) as \"a violation of the constitutional right of Protestant  [****36] subjects to keep and bear arms for their own defence.\"  49 The London Magazine or Gentleman's Monthly Intelligencer 467 (1780).  In response, another member of Parliament referred to \"the right of bearing arms for personal defence,\" making clear that no special military meaning for \"keep and bear arms\" was intended in the discussion.  Id., at 467-468. 15 \nc. Meaning of the Operative Clause.  Putting all of these textual elements together, HN10[] LEdHN[10][] [10] we find that they guarantee the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.  This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the Second Amendment.  We look to this because it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right.  The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it \"shall not be infringed.\"  As we said in United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 553, 23 L. Ed. 588 (1876), \"[t]his is not a right granted by the Constitution.  Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.  The [**2798]  second amendment declares  [***658] that it shall not be infringed . . . .\"16 \nBetween the Restoration and the Glorious Revolution, the Stuart Kings Charles II and James II succeeded in  [****38] using select militias loyal to them to suppress political dissidents, in part by disarming their opponents.  See J. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms 31-53 (1994) (hereinafter Malcolm); L. Schwoerer, The Declaration of Rights, 1689, p 76 (1981).   [*593]  Under the auspices of the 1671 Game Act, for example, the Catholic Charles II had ordered general disarmaments of regions home to his Protestant enemies.  See Malcolm 103-106.  These experiences caused Englishmen to be extremely wary of concentrated military forces run by the state and to be jealous of their arms.  They accordingly obtained an assurance from William and Mary, in the Declaration of Rights (which was codified as the English Bill of Rights), that Protestants would never be disarmed:  \"That the Subjects which are Protestants, may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions, and as allowed by Law.\"  1 W. & M., ch. 2, § 7, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441.  This right has long been understood to be the predecessor to our Second Amendment.  See E. Dumbauld, The Bill of Rights and What It Means Today 51 (1957); W. Rawle, A View of the Constitution of the United States of America 122 (1825) (hereinafter Rawle).  It was clearly an individual  [****39] right, having nothing whatever to do with service in a militia.  To be sure, it was an individual right not available to the whole population, given that it was restricted to Protestants, and like all written English rights it was held only against the Crown, not Parliament.  See Schwoerer, To Hold and Bear Arms:  The English Perspective, in Bogus 207, 218; but see 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 1858 (1833) (hereinafter Story) (contending that the \"right to bear arms\" is a \"limitatio[n] upon the power of parliament\" as well).  But it was secured to them as individuals, according to \"libertarian political principles,\" not as members of a fighting force.  Schwoerer, Declaration of Rights, at 283; see also id., at 78; G. Jellinek, The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens 49, and n 7 (1901) (reprinted 1979). \nBy the time of the founding, the right to have arms had become fundamental for English subjects.  See Malcolm 122-134.  Blackstone, whose works, we have said, \"constituted the preeminent authority on English law for the founding  [*594]  generation,\" Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 715, 119 S. Ct. 2240, 144 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1999), cited the arms provision of the Bill of Rights as one of the  [****40] fundamental rights of Englishmen.  See 1 Blackstone 136, 139-140 (1765).  His description of it cannot possibly be thought to tie it to militia or military service.  It was, he said, \"the natural right of resistance and self-preservation,\" id., at 139, and \"the right of having and using arms for self-preservation and defence,\" id., at 140; see also 3 id., at 2-4 (1768).  Other contemporary authorities concurred.  See G. Sharp, Tracts, Concerning the Ancient and Only True Legal Means of National Defence, by a Free Militia 17-18, 27 (3d ed. 1782); 2 J. de Lolme, The Rise and Progress of the English Constitution 886-887 (1784) (A.  [***659] Stephens ed. 1838); W. Blizard, Desultory Reflections on Police 59-60 (1785).  Thus, the right secured in 1689 as a result of the Stuarts' abuses was by the time of the founding understood to be an individual [**2799]  right protecting against both public and private violence. \nAnd, of course, what the Stuarts had tried to do to their political enemies, George III had tried to do to the colonists.  In the tumultuous decades of the 1760's and 1770's, the Crown began to disarm the inhabitants of the most rebellious areas.  That provoked polemical reactions by Americans invoking their  [****41] rights as Englishmen to keep arms.  A New York article of April 1769 said that \"[i]t is a natural right which the people have reserved to themselves, confirmed by the Bill of Rights, to keep arms for their own defence.\"  A Journal of the Times:  Mar. 17, New York Journal, Supp. 1, Apr. 13, 1769, in Boston Under Military Rule 79 (O. Dickerson ed. 1936) (reprinted 1970); see also, e.g., Shippen, Boston Gazette, Jan. 30, 1769, in 1 The Writings of Samuel Adams 299 (H. Cushing ed. 1904) (reprinted 1968).  They understood the right to enable individuals to defend themselves.  As the most important early American edition of Blackstone's Commentaries (by the law professor and former Antifederalist St. George Tucker) made clear in the notes to the  [*595]  description of the arms right, Americans understood the \"right of self-preservation\" as permitting a citizen to \"repe[l] force by force\" when \"the intervention of society in his behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury.\"  1 Blackstone's Commentaries 145-146, n 42 (1803) (hereinafter Tucker's Blackstone).  See also W. Duer, Outlines of the Constitutional Jurisprudence of the United States 31-32 (1833). \nHN11[] LEdHN[11][] [11]  There seems to us no doubt, on the basis of both text and history, that the Second Amendment  [****42] conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms.  Of course the right was not unlimited, just as the First Amendment's right of free speech was not, see, e.g., United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 128 S. Ct. 1830, 170 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2008).  Thus, we do not read the Second Amendment to protect the right of citizens to carry arms for any sort of confrontation, just as we do not read the First Amendment to protect the right of citizens to speak for any purpose.  Before turning to limitations upon the individual right, however, we must determine whether the prefatory clause of the Second Amendment comports with our interpretation of the operative clause. \n2. Prefatory Clause.\nThe prefatory clause reads:  \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State . . . .\" \na. \"Well-Regulated Militia.\"HN12[] LEdHN[12][] [12] In United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 179, 59 S. Ct. 816, 83 L. Ed. 1206, 1939-1 C.B. 373 (1939), we explained that \"the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense.\"  That definition comports with founding-era sources.  See, e.g., Webster (\"The militia of a country are the able bodied men organized into companies, regiments and brigades . . . and required by law to attend military exercises on certain days  [****43] only, but at other times left to pursue their usual occupations\"); The Federalist No. 46, pp 329, 334 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (\"near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands\"); Letter to Destutt de Tracy (Jan. 26, 1811), in The Portable Thomas  [*596]  Jefferson 520, 524 (M. Peterson ed. 1975) (\"the militia of the  [***660] State, that is to say, of every man in it able to bear arms\"). \nPetitioners take a seemingly narrower view of the militia, stating that \"[m]ilitias are the state- and congressionally-regulated military forces described in the Militia Clauses (art. I, § 8, cls. 15-16).\"  Brief for Petitioners 12.  Although we agree with petitioners' interpretive assumption that \"militia\" means the same thing in Article I  [**2800]  and the Second Amendment, we believe that petitioners identify the wrong thing, namely, the organized militia.  HN13[] LEdHN[13][] [13] Unlike armies and navies, which Congress is given the power to create (\"to raise . . . Armies\"; \"to provide . . . a Navy,\" Art. I, § 8, cls. 12-13), the militia is assumed by Article I already to be in existence.  Congress is given the power to \"provide for calling forth the Militia,\" § 8, cl. 15; and the power not to create, but to \"organiz[e]\" it--and  [****44] not to organize \"a\" militia, which is what one would expect if the militia were to be a federal creation, but to organize \"the\" militia, connoting a body already in existence, ibid., cl. 16.  This is fully consistent with the ordinary definition of the militia as all able-bodied men.  From that pool, Congress has plenary power to organize the units that will make up an effective fighting force.  That is what Congress did in the first Militia Act, which specified that \"each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective states, resident therein, who is or shall be of the age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled in the militia.\"  Act of May 8, 1792, 1 Stat. 271.  To be sure, Congress need not conscript every able-bodied man into the militia, because nothing in Article I suggests that in exercising its power to organize, discipline, and arm the militia, Congress must focus upon the entire body.  Although the militia consists of all able-bodied men, the federally organized militia may consist of a subset of them. \n [*597]  Finally, HN14[] LEdHN[14][] [14] the adjective \"well-regulated\" implies nothing more than  [****45] the imposition of proper discipline and training.  See Johnson 1619 (\"Regulate\":  \"To adjust by rule or method\"); Rawle 121-122; cf. Va. Declaration of Rights § 13 (1776), in 7 Thorpe 3812, 3814 (referring to \"a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms\"). \nb. \"Security of a Free State.\"HN15[] LEdHN[15][] [15] The phrase \"security of a free State\" meant \"security of a free polity,\" not security of each of the several States as the dissent below argued, see 478 F.3d at 405, and n 10.  Joseph Story wrote in his treatise on the Constitution that \"the word 'state' is used in various senses [and in] its most enlarged sense it means the people composing a particular nation or community.\"  1 Story § 208; see also 3 id., § 1890 (in reference to the Second Amendment's prefatory clause:  \"The militia is the natural defence of a free country\").  It is true that the term \"State\" elsewhere in the Constitution refers to individual States, but the phrase \"security of a free State\" and close variations seem to have been terms of art in 18th-century political discourse, meaning a \"'free country'\" or free polity.  See Volokh, \"Necessary to the Security of a Free State,\" 83 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1, 5 (2007);  [****46] see, e.g., 4 Blackstone 151 (1769); Brutus Essay III (Nov. 15, 1787), in The Essential Antifederalist 251, 253 (W. Allen & G. Lloyd eds., 2d ed. 2002).  Moreover, the other instances of  [***661] \"state\" in the Constitution are typically accompanied by modifiers making clear that the reference is to the several States--\"each state,\" \"several states,\" \"any state,\" \"that state,\" \"particular states,\" \"one state,\" \"no state.\"  And the presence of the term \"foreign state\" in Article I and Article III shows that the word \"state\" did not have a single meaning in the Constitution. \nThere are many reasons why the militia was thought to be \"necessary to the security of a free State.\"  See 3 Story § 1890.  First, of course, it is useful in repelling invasions and suppressing insurrections.  Second, it renders large  [*598]  standing armies unnecessary--an argument that Alexander Hamilton made in favor of federal control [**2801]  over the militia.  The Federalist No. 29, pp 226, 227 (B. Wright ed. 1961).  Third, when the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny. \n3. Relationship Between Prefatory Clause and Operative Clause.\nWe reach the question, then:  HN16[] LEdHN[16][] [16] Does  [****47] the preface fit with an operative clause that creates an individual right to keep and bear arms?  It fits perfectly, once one knows the history that the founding generation knew and that we have described above.  That history showed that the way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all the able-bodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking away the people's arms, enabling a select militia or standing army to suppress political opponents.  This is what had occurred in England that prompted codification of the right to have arms in the English Bill of Rights. \nThe debate with respect to the right to keep and bear arms, as with other guarantees in the Bill of Rights, was not over whether it was desirable (all agreed that it was) but over whether it needed to be codified in the Constitution.  During the 1788 ratification debates, the fear that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive in Antifederalist rhetoric.  See, e.g., Letters from The Federal Farmer III (Oct. 10, 1787), in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 234, 242 (H. Storing ed. 1981). John Smilie, for example, worried not only  [****48] that Congress's \"command of the militia\" could be used to create a \"select militia,\" or to have \"no militia at all,\" but also, as a separate concern, that \"[w]hen a select militia is formed; the people in general may be disarmed.\"  2 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 508-509 (M. Jensen ed. 1976) (hereinafter  [*599]  Documentary Hist.).  Federalists responded that because Congress was given no power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, such a force could never oppress the people.  See, e.g., A Pennsylvanian III (Feb. 20, 1788), in The Origin of the Second Amendment 275, 276 (D. Young ed., 2d ed. 2001) (hereinafter Young); White, To the Citizens of Virginia (Feb. 22, 1788), in id., at 280, 281; A Citizen of America (Oct. 10, 1787), in id., at 38, 40; Foreign Spectator Remarks on the Amendments to the Federal Constitution, Nov. 7, 1788, in id., at 556.  It was understood across the political spectrum that the right helped to secure the ideal of a citizen militia, which might be necessary to oppose an oppressive military force if the constitutional order broke down. \nIt is therefore entirely sensible that  [***662] the Second Amendment's prefatory clause announces the purpose  [****49] for which the right was codified:  to prevent elimination of the militia.  The prefatory clause does not suggest that preserving the militia was the only reason Americans valued the ancient right; most undoubtedly thought it even more important for self-defense and hunting.  But the threat that the new Federal Government would destroy the citizens' militia by taking away their arms was the reason that right--unlike some other English rights--was codified in a written Constitution.  Justice Breyer's assertion that individual self-defense is merely a \"subsidiary interest\" of the right to keep and bear arms, see post, at 714, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 731(dissenting opinion), is profoundly mistaken.  He bases that assertion solely upon the prologue--but that can only show that self-defense had little to do with the right's codification; it was the central component of the right itself. \nBesides ignoring the historical reality that the Second Amendment was not intended to lay down a \"novel principl[e]\" [**2802]  but rather codified a right \"inherited from our English ancestors,\" Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275, 281, 17 S. Ct. 326, 41 L. Ed. 715 (1897), petitioners' interpretation does not even achieve the narrower  [*600]  purpose that prompted codification of the right.  If, as they believe,  [****50] the Second Amendment right is no more than the right to keep and use weapons as a member of an organized militia, see Brief for Petitioners 8--if, that is, the organized militia is the sole institutional beneficiary of the Second Amendment's guarantee--it does not assure the existence of a \"citizens' militia\" as a safeguard against tyranny.  For Congress retains plenary authority to organize the militia, which must include the authority to say who will belong to the organized force.17   That is why the first Militia Act's requirement that only whites enroll caused States to amend their militia laws to exclude free blacks.  See Siegel, The Federal Government's Power to Enact Color-Conscious Laws, 92 Nw. U. L. Rev. 477, 521-525 (1998).  Thus, if petitioners are correct, the Second Amendment protects citizens' right to use a gun in an organization from which Congress has plenary authority to exclude them.  It guarantees a select militia of the sort the Stuart kings found useful, but not the people's militia that was the concern of the founding generation. \nB \nOur interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately  [*601]  followed adoption of the Second Amendment.  Four States adopted analogues to the Federal Second Amendment in the period between  [***663] independence and the ratification of the Bill of Rights.  Two of them--Pennsylvania and Vermont--clearly adopted individual rights  [****52] unconnected to militia service.  Pennsylvania's Declaration of Rights of 1776 said:  \"That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state . . . .\"  § XIII, in 5 Thorpe 3082, 3083 (emphasis added).  In 1777, Vermont adopted the identical provision, except for inconsequential differences in punctuation and capitalization.  See Vt. Const., ch. 1, § XV, in 6 id., at 3741. \nNorth Carolina also codified a right to bear arms in 1776:  \"That the people have a right to bear arms, for the defence of the State . . . .\"  Declaration of Rights § XVII, in 5 id., at 2787, 2788.  This could plausibly be read to support only a right to bear arms in a militia--but that is a peculiar way to make the point in a constitution that elsewhere repeatedly mentions the militia explicitly.  See N. C. Const., §§ XIV, XVIII, XXXV, in id., at 2789, 2791, 2793.  Many colonial statutes required individual arms bearing for public-safety reasons--such as the 1770 Georgia law that \"for the security and defence of this province from internal dangers and insurrections\" required those men who qualified for militia duty individually \"to carry fire arms\" \"to places of [**2803]  public worship.\"  19 Colonial Records of the State of  [****53] Georgia 137-139 (A. Candler ed. 1911 (pt. 1)) (emphasis added).  That broad public-safety understanding was the connotation given to the North Carolina right by that State's Supreme Court in 1843.  See State v. Huntly, 25 N.C. 418, 422-423. \nThe 1780 Massachusetts Constitution presented another variation on the theme:  \"The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. . . .\"  Pt. First, Art. XVII, in 3 Thorpe 1888, 1892.  Once again, if one gives narrow meaning to the phrase \"common defence\" this can be thought to limit the right to the bearing of arms in a  [*602]  state-organized military force.  But once again the State's highest court thought otherwise.  Writing for the court in an 1825 libel case, Chief Justice Parker wrote:  \"The liberty of the press was to be unrestrained, but he who used it was to be responsible in cases of its abuse; like the right to keep fire arms, which does not protect him who uses them for annoyance or destruction.\"  Commonwealth v. Blanding, 20 Mass. 304, 313-314, 3 Pick. 304The analogy makes no sense if firearms could not be used for any individual purpose at all.  See also Kates, Handgun Prohibition and the Original Meaning of the Second Amendment, 82 Mich. L. Rev. 204, 244 (1983)  [****54] (19th-century courts never read \"common defence\" to limit the use of weapons to militia service). \nWe therefore believe that the most likely reading of all four of these pre-Second Amendment state constitutional provisions is that they secured an individual right to bear arms for defensive purposes.  Other States did not include rights to bear arms in their pre-1789 constitutions-- although in Virginia a Second Amendment analogue was proposed (unsuccessfully) by Thomas Jefferson.  (It read:  \"No freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms [within his own lands or tenements].\"18   1 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 344 (J. Boyd ed. 1950).)\n [***664]  Between 1789 and 1820, nine States adopted Second Amendment analogues.  Four of them--Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, and Missouri-- referred to the right of the people to \"bear arms in defence of themselves and the State.\"  See n. 8, supra  [****55]  Another three States--Mississippi, Connecticut, and Alabama--used the even more individualistic phrasing that each citizen has the \"right to bear arms in defence of himself and the State.\"  See ibid.  Finally, two States--Tennessee and Maine--used the \"common defence\" language  [*603]  of Massachusetts.  See Tenn. Const., Art. XI, § 26 (1796), in 6 Thorpe 3414, 3424; Me. Const., Art. I, § 16 (1819), in 3 id., at 1646, 1648.  That of the nine state constitutional protections for the right to bear arms enacted immediately after 1789 at least seven unequivocally protected an individual citizen's right to self-defense is strong evidence that that is how the founding generation conceived of the right.  And with one possible exception that we discuss in Part II-D-2, 19th-century courts and commentators interpreted these state constitutional provisions to protect an individual right to use arms for self-defense.  See n. 9, supra; Simpson v. State, 13 Tenn. 356, 5 Yer. 356, 360 (Tenn. 1833). \nThe historical narrative that petitioners must endorse would thus treat the Federal Second Amendment as an odd outlier, protecting a right unknown in state constitutions or at English common law, based on [**2804]  little more than  [****56] an overreading of the prefatory clause. \nC \nJustice Stevens relies on the drafting history of the Second Amendment--the various proposals in the state conventions and the debates in Congress.  It is dubious to rely on such history to interpret a text that was widely understood to codify a pre-existing right, rather than to fashion a new one.  But even assuming that this legislative history is relevant, Justice Stevens flatly misreads the historical record. \nIt is true, as Justice Stevens says, that there was concern that the Federal Government would abolish the institution of the state militia.  See post, at 655, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 695.  That concern found expression, however, not in the various Second Amendment precursors proposed in the state conventions, but in separate structural provisions that would have given the States concurrent and seemingly non-pre-emptible authority to organize, discipline, and arm the militia when the Federal Government failed to do so.  See Veit 17, 20 (Virginia proposal); 4 J. Eliot, The Debates in the Several State  [*604]  Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 244, 245 (2d ed. 1836) (reprinted 1941) (North Carolina proposal); see also 2 Documentary Hist. 624 (Pennsylvania minority's  [****57] proposal).  The Second Amendment precursors, by contrast, referred to the individual English right already codified in two (and probably four) state constitutions.  The Federalist-dominated first Congress chose to reject virtually all major structural revisions favored by the Antifederalists, including the proposed militia amendments.  Rather, it adopted primarily the popular and uncontroversial (though, in the Federalists' view, unnecessary) individual-rights amendments.  The Second Amendment right,  [***665] protecting only individuals' liberty to keep and carry arms, did nothing to assuage Antifederalists' concerns about federal control of the militia.  See, e.g., Centinel, Revived, No. XXIX, Philadelphia Independent Gazetteer, Sept. 9, 1789, in Young 711, 712. \nJustice Stevens thinks it significant that the Virginia, New York, and North Carolina Second Amendment proposals were \"embedded . . . within a group of principles that are distinctly military in meaning,\" such as statements about the danger of standing armies.  Post, at 657, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 696.  But so was the highly influential minority proposal in Pennsylvania, yet that proposal, with its reference to hunting, plainly referred to an individual right.  See 2 Documentary  [****58] Hist. 624.  Other than that erroneous point, Justice Stevens has brought forward absolutely no evidence that those proposals conferred only a right to carry arms in a militia.  By contrast, New Hampshire's proposal, the Pennsylvania minority's proposal, and Samuel Adams' proposal in Massachusetts unequivocally referred to individual rights, as did two state constitutional provisions at the time.  See Veit 16, 17 (New Hampshire proposal); 6 Documentary Hist. 1452, 1453 (J. Kaminski & G. Saladino eds. 2000) (Samuel Adams' proposal).  Justice Stevens' view thus relies on the proposition, unsupported by any evidence, that different people of the founding period  [*605]  had vastly different conceptions of the right to keep and bear arms.  That simply does not comport with our longstanding view that the Bill of Rights codified venerable, widely understood liberties. \nD \nWe now address how the Second Amendment was interpreted from immediately after its ratification through the end of the 19th century.  Before proceeding, [**2805]  however, we take issue with Justice Stevens' equating of these sources with postenactment legislative history, a comparison that betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of a court's interpretive  [****59] task.  See post, at 662, n. 28, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 699.  HN17[] LEdHN[17][] [17] \"'[L]egislative history,'\" of course, refers to the preenactment statements of those who drafted or voted for a law; it is considered persuasive by some, not because they reflect the general understanding of the disputed terms, but because the legislators who heard or read those statements presumably voted with that understanding.  Ibid.  \"[P]ostenactment legislative history,\" ibid., a deprecatory contradiction in terms, refers to statements of those who drafted or voted for the law that are made after its enactment and hence could have had no effect on the congressional vote.  It most certainly does not refer to the examination of a variety of legal and other sources to determine the public understanding of a legal text in the period after its enactment or ratification.  That sort of inquiry is a critical tool of constitutional interpretation.  As we will show, virtually all interpreters of the Second Amendment in the century after its enactment interpreted the Amendment as we do. \n1. Postratification Commentary.\nThree important founding-era legal scholars interpreted the Second Amendment in published writings.  All three understood it to protect an individual right  [****60] unconnected with militia service. \n [*606]  St. George Tucker's version of  [***666] Blackstone's Commentaries, as we explained above, conceived of the Blackstonian arms right as necessary for self-defense.  He equated that right, absent the religious and class-based restrictions, with the Second Amendment.  See 2 Tucker's Blackstone 143.  In Note D, entitled, \"View of the Constitution of the United States,\" Tucker elaborated on the Second Amendment:  \"This may be considered as the true palladium of liberty . . . .  The right to self defence is the first law of nature:  in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine the right within the narrowest limits possible.  Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\"  1 id., at App. 300 (ellipsis in original).  He believed that the English game laws had abridged the right by prohibiting \"keeping a gun or other engine for the destruction of game.\"  Ibid.; see also 2 id., at 143, and nn 40 and 41.  He later grouped the right with some of the individual rights included in the First Amendment and  [****61] said that if \"a law be passed by congress, prohibiting\" any of those rights, it would \"be the province of the judiciary to pronounce whether any such act were constitutional, or not; and if not, to acquit the accused . . . .\"  1 id., at App. 357.  It is unlikely that Tucker was referring to a person's being \"accused\" of violating a law making it a crime to bear arms in a state militia.19 \n [*607]  In 1825, William Rawle, a prominent lawyer who had been a member of the Pennsylvania Assembly that ratified the [**2806]  Bill of Rights, published an influential treatise, which analyzed the Second Amendment  [****62] as follows: \n\"The first [principle] is a declaration that a well regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state; a proposition from which few will dissent. . . . \n\"The corollary, from the first position is, that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. \n\"The prohibition is general.  No clause in the constitution could by any rule of construction be conceived to give to congress a power to disarm the people.  Such a flagitious attempt could only be made under some general pretence by a state legislature.  But if in any blind pursuit of inordinate power, either should attempt it, this amendment may be appealed to as a restraint on both.\"  Rawle 121-122.20 \nLike Tucker, Rawle regarded the English game laws as violating the right codified in the Second Amendment.  See id., 122-123.  Rawle clearly differentiated  [***667] between the people's right to bear arms and their service in a militia:  \"In a people permitted and accustomed to bear arms, we have the rudiments of a militia, which properly consists of armed citizens, divided into military bands, and instructed at least in part, in the use of arms for the purposes of war.\"  Id., at 140.  Rawle further said that  [****63] the Second Amendment right ought not \"be abused to the disturbance of the public peace,\" such as by assembling with other armed individuals \"for an  [*608]  unlawful purpose\"--statements that make no sense if the right does not extend to any individual purpose. Id., at 123.\nJoseph Story published his famous Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States in 1833.  Justice Stevens suggests that \"[t]here is not so much as a whisper\" in Story's explanation of the Second Amendment that favors the individual-rights view.  Post, at 668, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 703.  That is wrong.  Story explained that the English Bill of Rights had also included a \"right to bear arms,\" a right that, as we have discussed, had nothing to do with militia service.  3 Story § 1858.  He then equated the English right with the Second Amendment: \n\"§ 1891.  A similar provision [to the Second Amendment] in favour of  [****64] protestants (for to them it is confined) is to be found in the bill of rights of 1688, it being declared, 'that the subjects, which are protestants, may have arms for their defence suitable to their condition, and as allowed by law.'  But under various pretences the effect of this provision has been greatly narrowed; and it is at present in England more nominal than real, as a defensive privilege.\" (Footnotes omitted.)\nThis comparison to the Declaration of Right would not make sense if the Second Amendment right was the right to use a gun in a militia, which was plainly not what the English right protected.  As the Tennessee Supreme Court recognized 38 years after Story wrote his Commentaries, \"[t]he passage from Story, shows clearly that this right was intended . . . and was guaranteed to, and to be exercised and enjoyed by the citizen as such, and not by him as a soldier, or in defense solely of his political rights.\"  Andrews v. State, 50 Tenn. 165, 183-184 (1871).  Story's Commentaries also cite as support Tucker and Rawle, both of whom clearly viewed the right as unconnected [**2807]  to militia service.  See 3 Story § 1890, n 2, § 1891, n 3.  In addition, in a shorter 1840 work Story wrote:  \"One  [****65] of the ordinary modes, by which  [*609]  tyrants accomplish their purposes without resistance, is, by disarming the people, and making it an offence to keep arms, and by substituting a regular army in the stead of a resort to the militia.\" A Familiar Exposition of the Constitution of the United States § 450 (reprinted 1986). \nAntislavery advocates routinely invoked the right to bear arms for self-defense.  Joel Tiffany, for example, citing Blackstone's description of the right, wrote that \"the right to keep and bear arms, also implies the right to use them if necessary in self defence; without this right to use the guaranty would have hardly been worth the paper it consumed.\"  A Treatise on the Unconstitutionality of American Slavery 117-118 (1849); see also L. Spooner, The Unconstitutionality of Slavery 116 (1845) (right enables \"personal defence\").  In his famous Senate speech about the 1856  [***668] \"Bleeding Kansas\" conflict, Charles Sumner proclaimed: \n\"The rifle has ever been the companion of the pioneer and, under God, his tutelary protector against the red man and the beast of the forest.  Never was this efficient weapon more needed in just self-defense, than now in Kansas, and at least one article  [****66] in our National Constitution must be blotted out, before the complete right to it can in any way be impeached.  And yet such is the madness of the hour, that, in defiance of the solemn guarantee, embodied in the Amendments to the Constitution, that 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,' the people of Kansas have been arraigned for keeping and bearing them, and the Senator from South Carolina has had the face to say openly, on this floor, that they should be disarmed--of course, that the fanatics of Slavery, his allies and constituents, may meet no impediment.\"  The Crime Against Kansas, May 19-20, 1856, in American Speeches:  Political Oratory From the Revolution to the Civil War 553, 606-607 (T. Widmer ed. 2006).\n [*610]  We have found only one early-19th century commentator who clearly conditioned the right to keep and bear arms upon service in the militia--and he recognized that the prevailing view was to the contrary.  \"The provision of the constitution, declaring the right of the people to keep and bear arms, &c. was probably intended to apply to the right of the people to bear arms for such [militia-related] purposes only, and not to prevent congress or the legislatures  [****67] of the different states from enacting laws to prevent the citizens from always going armed.  A different construction however has been given to it.\"  B. Oliver, The Rights of an American Citizen 177 (1832). \n2. Pre-Civil War Case Law.\nThe 19th-century cases that interpreted the Second Amendment universally support an individual right unconnected to militia service.  In Houston v. Moore, 18 U.S. 1, 5 Wheat. 1, 24, 5 L. Ed. 19 (1820), this Court held that States have concurrent power over the militia, at least where not pre-empted by Congress.  Agreeing in dissent that States could \"organize, arm, and discipline\" the militia in the absence of conflicting federal regulation, Justice Story said that the Second Amendment \"may not, perhaps, be thought to have any important bearing on this point.  If it have, it confirms and illustrates, rather than impugns the reasoning already suggested.\"  Id., at 51-53, 5 Wheat. 1, 24, 5 L. Ed. 19.  Of course, if the Amendment simply \"protect[ed] the right of the people of each of the several States to maintain a well-regulated militia,\" post, at 637, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 684 (Stevens, J., dissenting), it would have enormous [**2808]  and obvious bearing on the point.  But the Court and Story derived the States' power over the militia from the nonexclusive  [****68] nature of federal power, not from the Second Amendment, whose preamble merely \"confirms and illustrates\" the importance of the militia.  Even clearer was Justice Baldwin.  In the famous fugitive-slave case of Johnson v. Tompkins, 13 F. Cas. 840, 850, 852, [*611]  F. Cas. No. 7416 (CC Pa. 1833), Baldwin, sitting as a Circuit Judge, cited both the Second Amendment and the Pennsylvania analogue for his conclusion that a citizen has \"a right to carry arms in defence of his property or person, and to use them, if either were assailed with such force, numbers or violence  [***669] as made it necessary for the protection or safety of either.\" \nMany early-19th century state cases indicated that the Second Amendment right to bear arms was an individual right unconnected to militia service, though subject to certain restrictions.  A Virginia case in 1824 holding that the Constitution did not extend to free blacks explained: \"[n]umerous restrictions imposed on [blacks] in our Statute Book, many of which are inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, both of this State and of the United States as respects the free whites, demonstrate, that, here, those instruments have not been considered to extend equally to both  [****69] classes of our population.  We will only instance the restriction upon the migration of free blacks into this State, and upon their right to bear arms.\"  Aldridge v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. 447, 2 Va. Cas. 447, 449 (Gen. Ct.).  The claim was obviously not that blacks were prevented from carrying guns in the militia.21   See also Waters v. State, 1 Gill 302, 309 (Md.  [*612]  1843) (because free blacks were treated as a \"dangerous population,\" \"laws have been passed to prevent their migration into this State; to make it unlawful for them to bear arms; to guard even their religious assemblages with peculiar watchfulness\").  An 1829 decision by the Supreme Court of Michigan said:  \"The constitution of the United States also grants to the citizen the right to keep and bear arms.  But the grant of this privilege cannot be construed into the right in him who keeps a gun to destroy his neighbor.  No rights are intended to be granted by the constitution for an unlawful or unjustifiable purpose.\"  United States v. Sheldon, in 5 Transactions of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Michigan 337, 346 (W. Blume ed. 1940) (hereinafter Blume).  It is not possible to read this as discussing anything other than an individual right  [****70] unconnected to militia service.  If it did have to do with militia service, the limitation upon it would not be any \"unlawful or unjustifiable purpose,\" but any nonmilitary purpose whatsoever. \n [**2809] In Nunn v. State, 1 Ga. 243, 251 (1846), the Georgia Supreme Court construed the Second Amendment as protecting the \"natural right of self-defence\" and therefore struck down a ban on carrying pistols openly.  Its opinion perfectly captured the way in which the operative clause of the Second Amendment furthers the purpose announced in the prefatory clause, in continuity with the English right: \n\"The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and  [***670] bear arms of every description, and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained:  the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary  [*613]  to the security of a free State.  Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this right, originally  [****72] belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I.  and his two wicked sons and successors, re-established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Charta!\" Ibid.\nLikewise, in State v. Chandler, 5 La. Ann. 489, 490 (1850), the Louisiana Supreme Court held that citizens had a right to carry arms openly:  \"This is the right guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, and which is calculated to incite men to a manly and noble defence of themselves, if necessary, and of their country, without any tendency to secret advantages and unmanly assassinations.\" \nThose who believe that the Second Amendment preserves only a militia-centered right place great reliance on the Tennessee Supreme Court's 1840 decision in Aymette v. State, 21 Tenn. 154.  The case does not stand for that broad proposition; in fact, the case does not mention the word \"militia\" at all, except in its quoting of the Second Amendment.  Aymette held that the state constitutional guarantee of the right to \"bear\" arms did not prohibit the banning of concealed weapons.  The opinion first recognized that both the state right and  [****73] the federal right were descendents of the 1689 English right, but (erroneously, and contrary to virtually all other authorities) read that right to refer only to \"protect[ion of] the public liberty\" and \"keep[ing] in awe those who are in power,\" id., at 158.  The court then adopted a sort of middle position, whereby citizens were permitted to carry arms openly, unconnected with any service in a formal militia, but were given the right to use them only for the military purpose of banding together to oppose tyranny.  This odd reading of the right is, to be sure, not the one we adopt--but it is not petitioners' reading either.  More importantly, seven years earlier the Tennessee Supreme Court  [*614]  had treated the state constitutional provision as conferring a right \"to all the free citizens of the State to keep and bear arms for their defence,\" Simpson, 5 Yer., at 360; and 21 years later the court held that the \"keep\" portion of the state constitutional right included the right to personal self-defense:  \"[T]he right to keep arms involves, necessarily, the right to use such arms for all the ordinary purposes, and in all the ordinary modes usual in the country, and to which arms are adapted, limited by  [****74] the duties of a good citizen in times of peace.\"  Andrews, 50 Tenn., at 178-179; see also ibid. (equating state provision with Second Amendment). \n3. Post-Civil War Legislation.\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, there was an outpouring of discussion of the Second Amendment in Congress and in public discourse, as people debated whether [**2810]  and how to secure constitutional rights for newly free slaves.  See generally S. Halbrook, Freedmen, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Right to Bear Arms, 1866-1876 (1998) (hereinafter Halbrook); Brief for Institute for Justice  [***671] as Amicus Curiae.  Since those discussions took place 75 years after the ratification of the Second Amendment, they do not provide as much insight into its original meaning as earlier sources.  Yet those born and educated in the early 19th century faced a widespread effort to limit arms ownership by a large number of citizens; their understanding of the origins and continuing significance of the Amendment is instructive. \nBlacks were routinely disarmed by Southern States after the Civil War.  Those who opposed these injustices frequently stated that they infringed blacks' constitutional right to keep and bear arms.  Needless to say, the claim  [****75] was not that blacks were being prohibited from carrying arms in an organized state militia.  A Report of the Commission of the Freedmen's Bureau in 1866 stated plainly:  \"[T]he civil law [of Kentucky] prohibits the colored man from bearing arms. . . .  Their arms are taken from them by the civil  [*615]  authorities. . . .  Thus, the right of the people to keep and bear arms as provided in the Constitution is infringed.\" H. R. Exec. Doc. No. 70, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 233, 236.  A joint congressional Report decried: \n\"[I]n some parts of [South Carolina,] armed parties are, without proper authority, engaged in seizing all fire-arms found in the hands of the freedmen.  Such conduct is in plain and direct violation of their personal rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, which declares that 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.'  The freedmen of South Carolina have shown by their peaceful and orderly conduct that they can safely be trusted with fire-arms, and they need them to kill game for subsistence, and to protect their crops from destruction by birds and animals.\" Joint Comm. on Reconstruction, H. R. Rep. No. 30, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2,  [****76] p 229 (1866) (Proposed Circular of Brigadier General R. Saxton).\nThe view expressed in these statements was widely reported and was apparently widely held.  For example, an editorial in The Loyal Georgian (Augusta) on February 3, 1866, assured blacks that \"[a]ll men, without distinction of color, have the right to keep and bear arms to defend their homes, families or themselves.\"  Halbrook 19. \nCongress enacted the Freedmen's Bureau Act on July 16, 1866.  Section 14 stated: \n\"[T]he right . . . to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal, including the constitutional right to bear arms, shall be secured to and enjoyed by all the citizens . . . without respect to race or color, or previous condition of slavery. . . .\"  14 Stat. 176-177.\nThe understanding that the Second Amendment gave freed blacks the right to keep and bear arms was reflected in congressional  [*616]  discussion of the bill, with even an opponent of it saying that the founding generation \"were for every man bearing his arms about him and keeping them in his house, his castle, for his own defense.\"   [****77] Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 362, 371 (1866) (Sen. Davis). \nSimilar discussion attended the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 and the Fourteenth Amendment.  For  [***672] example, Representative Butler said of the Act:  \"Section eight is intended to enforce the well-known constitutional provision guaranteeing [**2811]  the right of the citizen to 'keep and bear arms,' and provides that whoever shall take away, by force or violence, or by threats and intimidation, the arms and weapons which any person may have for his defense, shall be deemed guilty of larceny of the same.\"  H. R. Rep. No. 37, 41st Cong., 3d Sess., 7-8 (1871).  With respect to the proposed Amendment, Senator Pomeroy described as one of the three \"indispensable\" \"safeguards of liberty . . . under the Constitution\" a man's \"right to bear arms for the defense of himself and family and his homestead.\"  Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1182 (1866).  Representative Nye thought the Fourteenth Amendment unnecessary because \"[a]s citizens of the United States [blacks] have equal right to protection, and to keep and bear arms for self-defense.\"  Id., at 1073. \nIt was plainly the understanding in the post-Civil War Congress that the  [****78] Second Amendment protected an individual right to use arms for self-defense. \n4. Post-Civil War Commentators.\nEvery late-19th century legal scholar that we have read interpreted the Second Amendment to secure an individual right unconnected with militia service.  The most famous was the judge and professor Thomas Cooley, who wrote a massively popular 1868 Treatise on Constitutional Limitations.  Concerning the Second Amendment it said: \n\"Among the other defences to personal liberty should be mentioned the right of the people to keep and bear  [*617]  arms. . . .  The alternative to a standing army is 'a well-regulated militia,' but this cannot exist unless the people are trained to bearing arms.  How far it is in the power of the legislature to regulate this right, we shall not undertake to say, as happily there has been very little occasion to discuss that subject by the courts.\"  Id., at 350.\nThat Cooley understood the right not as connected to militia service, but as securing the militia by ensuring a populace familiar with arms, is made even clearer in his 1880 work, General Principles of Constitutional Law.  The Second Amendment, he said, \"was adopted with some modification and enlargement from the  [****79] English Bill of Rights of 1688, where it stood as a protest against arbitrary action of the overturned dynasty in disarming the people.\"  Id., at 270.  In a section entitled \"The Right in General,\" he continued: \n\"It might be supposed from the phraseology of this provision that the right to keep and bear arms was only guaranteed to the militia; but this would be an interpretation not warranted by the intent.  The militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty, and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon.  But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check.  The meaning of the provision undoubtedly  [***673] is, that the people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have the right to keep and bear arms; and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose.  But this enables government  [****80] to have a well-regulated militia; for to bear arms implies something more than the mere keeping; it  [*618]  implies the learning to handle and use them in a way that makes those who keep them ready for their [**2812]  efficient use; in other words, it implies the right to meet for voluntary discipline in arms, observing in doing so the laws of public order.\"  Id., at 271.\nAll other post-Civil War 19th-century sources we have found concurred with Cooley.  One example from each decade will convey the general flavor: \n\"[The purpose of the Second Amendment is] to secure a well-armed militia. . . .  But a militia would be useless unless the citizens were enabled to exercise themselves in the use of warlike weapons.  To preserve this privilege, and to secure to the people the ability to oppose themselves in military force against the usurpations of government, as well as against enemies from without, that government is forbidden by any law or proceeding to invade or destroy the right to keep and bear arms. . . .  The clause is analogous to the one securing the freedom of speech and of the press.  Freedom, not license, is secured; the fair use, not the libellous abuse, is protected.\" J. Pomeroy, An Introduction to  [****81] the Constitutional Law of the United States §239, pp. 152-153 (1868) (hereinafter Pomeroy). \n\"As the Constitution of the United States, and the constitutions of several of the states, in terms more or less comprehensive, declare the right of the people to keep and bear arms, it has been a subject of grave discussion, in some of the state courts, whether a statute prohibiting persons, when not on a journey, or as travellers, from wearing or carrying concealed weapons, be constitutional.  There has been a great difference of opinion on the question.\"  2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *340, n 2 (O. Holmes ed., 12th ed. 1873) (hereinafter Kent). \n [*619]  \"Some general knowledge of firearms is important to the public welfare; because it would be impossible, in case of war, to organize promptly an efficient force of volunteers unless the people had some familiarity with weapons of war.  The Constitution secures the right of the people to keep and bear arms.  No doubt, a citizen who keeps a gun or pistol under judicious precautions, practises in safe places the use of it, and in due time teaches his sons to do the same, exercises his individual right.  No doubt, a person whose residence or duties involve peculiar  [****82] peril may keep a pistol for prudent self-defence.\"  B. Abbott, Judge and Jury:  A Popular Explanation of the Leading Topics in the Law of the Land 333 (1880) (hereinafter Abbott). \n\"The right to bear arms has always been the distinctive privilege of freemen.  Aside from any necessity of self-protection to the person, it represents among all nations power coupled with the exercise of a certain jurisdiction.  . . .  [I]t was not necessary that the right to bear  [***674] arms should be granted in the Constitution, for it had always existed.\" J. Ordronaux, Constitutional Legislation in the United States 241-242 (1891).\nE \nWe now ask whether any of our precedents forecloses the conclusions we have reached about the meaning of the Second Amendment. \nHN18[] LEdHN[18][] [18]United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 23 L. Ed. 588, in the course of vacating the convictions of members of a white mob for depriving blacks of their right to keep and bear arms, held that the Second Amendment does not by its own force apply to anyone other than the Federal Government.  The opinion explained that the right \"is not a right granted by the Constitution [or] in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.  [**2813]  The second amendment . . . means no more  [****83]  [*620]  than that it shall not be infringed by Congress.\"  Id. at 553, 23 L. Ed. 588.  States, we said, were free to restrict or protect the right under their police powers.  The limited discussion of the Second Amendment in Cruikshank supports, if anything, the individual-rights interpretation.  There was no claim in Cruikshank that the victims had been deprived of their right to carry arms in a militia; indeed, the Governor had disbanded the local militia unit the year before the mob's attack, see C. Lane, The Day Freedom Died 62 (2008).  We described the right protected by the Second Amendment as \"'bearing arms for a lawful purpose'\" 22  and said that \"the people [must] look for their protection against any violation by their fellow-citizens of the rights it recognizes\" to the States' police power.  92 U.S., at 553, 23 L. Ed. 588.  That discussion makes little sense if it is only a right to bear arms in a state militia.23 \nPresser v. Illinois, 116 U.S. 252, 6 S. Ct. 580, 29 L. Ed. 615 (1886), held that the right to keep and bear arms was not violated by a law that forbade \"bodies of men to associate together as military organizations, or to drill or parade with arms in cities and towns unless authorized by law.\"  Id., at 264-265, 6 S. Ct. 580, 29 L. Ed. 615.  This does not refute the individual-rights interpretation of the Amendment; no one supporting that interpretation has contended that States may not ban such groups.  Justice Stevens  [*621]  presses Presser into service to support his view that the right to bear arms is limited to service in the militia by joining Presser's brief discussion  [****85] of the Second Amendment with a later portion of the opinion making the seemingly relevant (to the Second Amendment) point that the plaintiff was not a member of the state militia.  Unfortunately for Justice Stevens' argument, that later portion deals with the Fourteenth Amendment; it was  [***675] the Fourteenth Amendment to which the plaintiff's nonmembership in the militia was relevant.  Thus, Justice Stevens' statement that Presser \"suggested that. . . nothing in the Constitution protected the use of arms outside the context of a militia,\" post, at 674-675, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 707, is simply wrong.  Presser said nothing about the Second Amendment's meaning or scope, beyond the fact that it does not prevent the prohibition of private paramilitary organizations. \nJustice Stevens places overwhelming reliance upon this Court's decision in Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 59 S. Ct. 816, 83 L. Ed. 1206, 1939-1 C.B. 373.  \"[H]undreds of judges,\" we are told, \"have relied on the view of the Amendment we endorsed there,\" post, at 638, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 685, and \"[e]ven if the textual and historical arguments on both sides of the issue were evenly balanced, respect for the well-settled views of all of our predecessors on this Court, and for the rule of law itself . . . would prevent most [**2814]  jurists  [****86] from endorsing such a dramatic upheaval in the law,\" post, at 639, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 686.  And what is, according to Justice Stevens, the holding of Miller that demands such obeisance?  That the Second Amendment \"protects the right to keep and bear arms for certain military purposes, but that it does not curtail the Legislature's power to regulate the nonmilitary use and ownership of weapons.\"  Post, at 637, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 685. \nNothing so clearly demonstrates the weakness of Justice Stevens' case.  Miller did not hold that and cannot possibly be read to have held that.  The judgment in the case upheld against a Second Amendment challenge two men's federal indictment for transporting an unregistered short-barreled  [*622]  shotgun in interstate commerce, in violation of the National Firearms Act, 48 Stat. 1236.  It is entirely clear that the Court's basis for saying that the Second Amendment did not apply was not that the defendants were \"bear[ing] arms\" not \"for . . . military purposes\" but for \"nonmilitary use,\" post, at 637, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 685.  Rather, it was that the type of weapon at issue was not eligible for Second Amendment protection:  \"In the absence of any evidence tending to show that the possession or use of a [short-barreled shotgun] at this time has some  [****87] reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument.\" 307 U.S., at 178, 59 S. Ct. 816, 83 L. Ed. 1206 (emphasis added).  \"Certainly,\" the Court continued, \"it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\"  Ibid.  Beyond that, the opinion provided no explanation of the content of the right. \nThis holding is not only consistent with, but positively suggests, that the Second Amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms (though only arms that \"have some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia\").  Had the Court believed that the Second Amendment protects only those serving in the militia, it would have been odd to examine the character of the weapon rather than simply note that the two crooks were not militiamen.  Justice Stevens can say again and again that Miller did not \"turn on the difference between muskets and sawed-off shotguns; it  [***676] turned, rather, on the basic difference between the military and nonmilitary use and possession  [****88] of guns,\" post, at 677, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 708, but the words of the opinion prove otherwise.  The most Justice Stevens can plausibly claim for Miller is that it declined to decide the nature of the Second Amendment right, despite the Solicitor General's argument (made in the alternative) that the right was collective, see Brief for United States, O. T. 1938,  [*623]  No. 696, pp 4-5.  Miller stands only for the proposition that the Second Amendment right, whatever its nature, extends only to certain types of weapons. \nIt is particularly wrongheaded to read Miller for more than what it said, because the case did not even purport to be a thorough examination of the Second Amendment.  Justice Stevens claims, post, at 676-677, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 708, that the opinion reached its conclusion \"[a]fter reviewing many of the same sources that are discussed at greater length by the Court today.\"  Not many, which was not entirely the Court's fault.  The defendants made no appearance in the case, neither filing a brief nor appearing at oral argument; the Court heard from no one but the Government (reason enough, one would think, not to make that case the beginning and the end of this Court's consideration of the Second Amendment).  See Frye, The Peculiar Story  [****89] of United States v. Miller, 3 N. Y. U. J. L. & Liberty 48, 65-68 (2008).  The Government's [**2815]  brief spent two pages discussing English legal sources, concluding \"that at least the carrying of weapons without lawful occasion or excuse was always a crime\" and that (because of the class-based restrictions and the prohibition on terrorizing people with dangerous or unusual weapons) \"the early English law did not guarantee an unrestricted right to bear arms.\"  Brief for United States, O. T. 1938, No. 696, at 9-11.  It then went on to rely primarily on the discussion of the English right to bear arms in Aymette v. State, 21 Tenn. 154, for the proposition that the only uses of arms protected by the Second Amendment are those that relate to the militia, not self-defense.  See Brief for United States, O. T. 1938, No. 696, at 12-18.  The final section of the brief recognized that \"some courts have said that the right to bear arms includes the right of the individual to have them for the protection of his person and property,\" and launched an alternative argument that \"weapons which are commonly used by criminals,\" such as sawed-off shotguns, are not protected.  See id., at 18-21.  The Government's Miller  [****90] brief thus provided  [*624]  scant discussion of the history of the Second Amendment--and the Court was presented with no counterdiscussion.  As for the text of the Court's opinion itself, that discusses none of the history of the Second Amendment.  It assumes from the prologue that the Amendment was designed to preserve the militia, 307 U.S., at 178, 59 S. Ct. 816, 83 L. Ed. 1206 (which we do not dispute), and then reviews some historical materials dealing with the nature of the militia, and in particular with the nature of the arms their members were expected to possess, id., at 178-182, 59 S. Ct. 816, 83 L. Ed. 1206.  Not a word (not a word) about the history of the Second Amendment.  This is the  [***677] mighty rock upon which the dissent rests its case. 24 \nWe may as well consider at this point (for we will have to consider eventually) what types of weapons Miller permits.  Read in isolation, Miller's phrase \"part of ordinary military equipment\" could mean that only those weapons useful in warfare are protected.  That would be a startling reading of the opinion, since it would mean that the National Firearms Act's restrictions on machineguns (not challenged in Miller) might be unconstitutional, machineguns being useful in warfare in 1939.  HN19[] LEdHN[19][] [19] We think that Miller's \"ordinary military equipment\" language must be read in tandem with what comes after:  \"[O]rdinarily when called for [militia] service [able-bodied] men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\"  307 U.S., at 179, 59 S. Ct. 816, 83 L. Ed. 1206.  The traditional militia was formed from a pool of men bringing arms \"in common use at the time\" for lawful purposes like self-defense.  \"In the colonial  [*625]  and revolutionary war era, [small-arms] weapons used by militiamen and weapons used in defense of person and home were one and the same.\"  State v. Kessler, 289 Ore. 359, 368, 614 P.2d 94, 98 (1980) (citing G.  [****92] Neumann, Swords and Blades of the American Revolution 6-15, 252-254 (1973)).  Indeed, that is precisely the way in which the Second Amendment's operative clause furthers the purpose announced in its preface.  We therefore read Miller to say only that the Second Amendment  [**2816]  does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, such as short-barreled shotguns.  That accords with the historical understanding of the scope of the right, see Part III, infra25 \nWe conclude that nothing in our precedents forecloses our adoption of the original understanding of the Second Amendment.  It should be unsurprising that such a significant matter has been for so long judicially unresolved.  For most of our history, the Bill of Rights was not thought applicable to the States, and the Federal Government did not significantly regulate the possession of firearms by law-abiding citizens.  Other provisions of the Bill of Rights have similarly  [***678] remained unilluminated for lengthy periods.  This Court first  [*626]  held a law to violate the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech in 1931, almost 150 years after the Amendment was ratified, see Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U.S. 697, 51 S. Ct. 625, 75 L. Ed. 1357 (1931), and it was not until after World War  [****94] II that we held a law invalid under the Establishment Clause, see Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Bd. of Educ., 333 U.S. 203, 68 S. Ct. 461, 92 L. Ed. 649 (1948).  Even a question as basic as the scope of proscribable libel was not addressed by this Court until 1964, nearly two centuries after the founding.  See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964).  It is demonstrably not true that, as Justice Stevens claims, post, at 676, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 707, \"for most of our history, the invalidity of Second-Amendment-based objections to firearms regulations has been well settled and uncontroversial.\"  For most of our history the question did not present itself. \nIII \nHN20[] LEdHN[20][] [20]  Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.  From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.  See, e.g., Sheldon, in 5 Blume 346; Rawle 123; Pomeroy 152-153; Abbott 333.  For example, the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state  [****95] analogues.  See, e.g., State v. Chandler, 5 La. Ann., at 489-490; Nunn v. State, 1 Ga., at 251; see generally 2 Kent *340, n 2; The American Students' Blackstone 84, n 11 (G. Chase ed. 1884).  Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession [**2817]  of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing  [*627]  conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.26 \nLEdHN[21][] [21]  HN21[] We also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms.  Miller said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those \"in common use at the time.\"  307 U.S., at 179, 59 S. Ct. 816, 83 L. Ed. 1206.  We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of \"dangerous and unusual weapons.\"  See 4 Blackstone 148-149 (1769); 3 B. Wilson, Works of the Honourable James Wilson 79 (1804);  [****96] J. Dunlap, The New-York Justice 8 (1815); C. Humphreys, A Compendium of the Common Law in Force in Kentucky 482 (1822); 1 W. Russell, A Treatise on Crimes and Indictable Misdemeanors 271-272 (1831); H. Stephen, Summary of the Criminal Law 48 (1840); E. Lewis, An Abridgment of the Criminal Law of the United States 64 (1847); F. Wharton, A Treatise on the Criminal Law of the United States 726 (1852).  See also State v. Langford,  [***679]  10 N. C. 381, 383-384 (1824); O'Neill v. State, 16 Ala. 65, 67 (1849); English v. State, 35 Tex. 473, 476 (1871); State v. Lanier, 71 N. C. 288, 289 (1874). \nIt may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military service--M-16 rifles and the like--may be banned, then the Second Amendment right is completely detached from the prefatory clause.  But as we have said, the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment's ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty.  It may well be true today that a militia, to be as effective as militias in the 18th century, would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at  [****97] large.  Indeed, it may be true that no amount of small arms could be useful against modern-day bombers and tanks.  But the fact that modern developments have limited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause  [*628]  and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right. \nIV \nWe turn finally to the law at issue here.  As we have said, the law totally bans handgun possession in the home.  It also requires that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock at all times, rendering it inoperable. \nAs the quotations earlier in this opinion demonstrate, HN22[] LEdHN[22][] [22] the inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right.  The handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of \"arms\" that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose.  The prohibition extends, moreover, to the home, where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute.  Under any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to enumerated constitutional rights, 27  banning from the home [**2818]  \"the most preferred firearm in the nation to 'keep' and use for  [*629]  protection of one's home and family,\" 478 F.3d at 400, would fail constitutional  [****98] muster. \nFew laws in the history of our Nation have come close to the severe restriction of the District's handgun ban.  And some of those few have been struck down.  In Nunn v. State, the Georgia Supreme Court struck down a prohibition on carrying pistols openly (even though it upheld a prohibition on carrying concealed weapons).  See 1 Ga., at 251.  In Andrews v. State, the Tennessee Supreme Court likewise held that a statute that forbade openly carrying a pistol \"publicly  [***680] or privately, without regard to time or place, or circumstances,\" 50 Tenn., at 187, violated the state constitutional provision (which the court equated with the Second Amendment).  That was so even though the statute did not restrict the carrying of long guns.  Ibid.  See also State v. Reid, 1 Ala. 612, 616-617 (1840) (\"A statute which, under the pretence of regulating, amounts to a destruction of the right, or which requires arms to be so borne as to render them wholly useless for the purpose of defence, would be clearly unconstitutional\"). \nIt is no answer to say, as  [****100] petitioners do, that it is permissible to ban the possession of handguns so long as the possession of other firearms (i.e., long guns) is allowed.  It is enough to note, as we have observed, that the American people have considered the handgun to be the quintessential self-defense weapon.  There are many reasons that a citizen may prefer a handgun for home defense:  It is easier to store in a location that is readily accessible in an emergency; it cannot easily be redirected or wrestled away by an attacker; it is easier to use for those without the upper-body strength to lift and aim a long gun; it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police.  Whatever the reason, HN24[] LEdHN[24][] [24] handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home, and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid. \n [*630]  We must also address HN25[] LEdHN[25][] [25] the District's requirement (as applied to respondent's handgun) that firearms in the home be rendered and kept inoperable at all times.  This makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional.  The District argues that we should interpret this element of the statute to  [****101] contain an exception for self-defense.  See Brief for Petitioners 56-57.  But we think that is precluded by the unequivocal text, and by the presence of certain other enumerated exceptions:  \"Except for law enforcement personnel . . ., each registrant shall keep any firearm in his possession unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device unless such firearm is kept at his place of business, or while being used for lawful recreational purposes within the District of Columbia.\"  D. C. Code § 7-2507.02.  The nonexistence of a self-defense exception is also suggested by the D. C. Court of Appeals' statement that the statute forbids residents to use firearms to [**2819]  stop intruders, see McIntosh v. Washington, 395 A.2d 744, 755-756 (1978). 28 \nApart from his challenge to the handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement respondent asked the District Court to enjoin petitioners from enforcing the separate licensing requirement \"in such a manner as to forbid the carrying of a firearm within one's home or possessed land without a license.\"  App. 59a.  The Court of Appeals did not invalidate the licensing requirement, but held only that the District \"may not prevent [a handgun] from being moved throughout one's house.\"  478 F.3d at 400.  It then ordered the District Court to enter summary judgment \"consistent  [*631]  with  [***681] [respondent's] prayer for relief.\"  Id., at 401.  Before this Court petitioners have stated that \"if the handgun ban is struck down and respondent registers a handgun, he could obtain a license, assuming he is not otherwise disqualified,\" by which they apparently mean if he is not a felon and is not insane.  Brief for Petitioners 58.  Respondent conceded at oral argument that he does not \"have a problem with . . . licensing\" and that the District's law is permissible so long as it is \"not enforced in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 74-75.  We therefore assume that petitioners' issuance  [****103] of a license will satisfy respondent's prayer for relief and do not address the licensing requirement. \nJustice Breyer has devoted most of his separate dissent to the handgun ban.  He says that, even assuming the Second Amendment is a personal guarantee of the right to bear arms, the District's prohibition is valid.  He first tries to establish this by founding-era historical precedent, pointing to various restrictive laws in the colonial period.  These demonstrate, in his view, that the District's law \"imposes a burden upon gun owners that seems proportionately no greater than restrictions in existence at the time the Second Amendment was adopted.\"  Post, at 682, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 711.  Of the laws he cites, only one offers even marginal support for his assertion.  A 1783 Massachusetts law forbade the residents of Boston to \"take into\" or \"receive into\" \"any Dwelling-House, Stable, Barn, Out-house, Ware-house, Store, Shop or other Building\" loaded firearms, and permitted the seizure of any loaded firearms that \"shall be found\" there.  Act of Mar. 1, 1783, ch. XIII, 1783 Mass. Acts p 218.  That statute's text and its prologue, which makes clear that the purpose of the prohibition was to eliminate the danger to firefighters  [****104] posed by the \"depositing of loaded Arms\" in buildings, give reason to doubt that colonial Boston authorities would have enforced that general prohibition against someone who temporarily loaded a firearm to confront an intruder (despite the law's  [*632]  application in that case).  In any case, we would not stake our interpretation of the Second Amendment upon a single law, in effect in a single city, that contradicts the overwhelming weight of other evidence regarding the right to keep and bear arms for defense of the home.  The other laws Justice Breyer cites are gunpowder-storage laws that he concedes did not clearly prohibit loaded weapons, but required only that excess gunpowder be kept in a special container or on the top floor of the home. Post, at 686, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 713.  Nothing about those fire-safety laws undermines [**2820]  our analysis; they do not remotely burden the right of self-defense as much as an absolute ban on handguns.  Nor, correspondingly, does our analysis suggest the invalidity of laws regulating the storage of firearms to prevent accidents. \nJustice Breyer points to other founding-era laws that he says \"restricted the firing of guns within the city limits to at least some degree\" in Boston, Philadelphia,  [****105] and New York.  Post, at 683, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 712 (citing Churchill, Gun Regulation, the Police Power, and the Right to Keep Arms in Early America, 25 Law & Hist. Rev. 139, 162 (2007)).  Those laws provide no support for the severe restriction in the present case.  The New York law levied a fine of 20 shillings on anyone who fired a gun in certain places (including houses) on  [***682] New Year's Eve and the first two days of January, and was aimed at preventing the \"great Damages . . . frequently done on [those days] by persons going House to House, with Guns and other Fire Arms and being often intoxicated with Liquor.\"  Ch. 1501, 5 Colonial Laws of New York 244-246 (1894).  It is inconceivable that this law would have been enforced against a person exercising his right to self-defense on New Year's Day against such drunken hooligans.  The Pennsylvania law to which Justice Breyer refers levied a fine of five shillings on one who fired a gun or set off fireworks in Philadelphia without first obtaining a license from the Governor.  See Act of Aug. 26, 1721, ch. CCXLV, §IV, in 3 Stat. at Large of Pa. 253-254 (1896).  Given Justice Wilson's explanation  [*633]  that the right to self-defense with arms was protected by the Pennsylvania Constitution, it is unlikely that this  [****106] law (which in any event amounted to at most a licensing regime) would have been enforced against a person who used firearms for self-defense.  Justice Breyer cites a Rhode Island law that simply levied a five-shilling fine on those who fired guns in streets and taverns, a law obviously inapplicable to this case.  See An Act for preventing Mischief being done in the town of Newport, or in any other Town in this Government, 1731 Rhode Island Session Laws pp. 240-241.  Finally, Justice Breyer points to a Massachusetts law similar to the Pennsylvania law, prohibiting \"discharg[ing] any Gun or Pistol charged with Shot or Ball in the Town of Boston.\" Act of May 28, 1746, ch. X, Acts and Laws of Mass. Bay p. 208.  It is again implausible that this would have been enforced against a citizen acting in self-defense, particularly given its preambulatory reference to \"the indiscreet firing of Guns.\"  Ibid. (preamble) (emphasis added). \nA broader point about the laws that Justice Breyer cites:  All of them punished the discharge (or loading) of guns with a small fine and forfeiture of the weapon (or in a few cases a very brief stay in the local jail), not with significant criminal penalties.29   They are akin to modern  [****107] penalties for minor public-safety infractions like speeding or jaywalking.  And although such public-safety laws may not contain exceptions for self-defense, it is inconceivable that the threat of a jaywalking ticket would deter someone from disregarding a \"Do Not Walk\" sign in order to flee an attacker, or that the government would enforce those laws under such circumstances.  Likewise, we do not think that a law imposing a  [*634]  5-shilling fine and forfeiture of the gun would have prevented a person in the founding era from using a [**2821]  gun to protect himself or his family from violence, or that if he did so the law would be enforced against him.  The District law, by contrast, far from imposing a minor fine, threatens citizens with a year in prison (five years for a second violation) for even obtaining a gun in the first place.  See D. C. Code § 7-2507.06. \nJustice Breyer moves on to make a broad jurisprudential point:  He criticizes us for declining to establish a level of scrutiny for evaluating Second Amendment restrictions.  He proposes, explicitly at least, none of the traditionally expressed levels (strict  [***683] scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, rational basis), but rather a judge-empowering \"interest-balancing inquiry\" that \"asks whether the statute burdens a protected interest in a way or to an extent that is out of proportion to the statute's salutary effects upon other important governmental interests.\"  Post, at 689-690, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 716.  After an exhaustive discussion of the arguments for and against gun control, Justice Breyer arrives at his interest-balanced answer:  Because handgun violence is a problem, because the law is limited to an urban area, and because there were somewhat similar restrictions in the founding period (a false proposition that we have already discussed), the interest-balancing inquiry results in the constitutionality of the handgun ban.  QED. \nWe know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \"interest-balancing\" approach.  The very  [****109] enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government--even the Third Branch of Government--the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon.  A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges' assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all.  Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted  [*635]  them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad.  We would not apply an \"interest-balancing\" approach to the prohibition of a peaceful neo-Nazi march through Skokie.  See National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U.S. 43, 97 S. Ct. 2205, 53 L. Ed. 2d 96 (1977) (per curiam).  The First Amendment contains the freedom-of-speech guarantee that the people ratified, which included exceptions for obscenity, libel, and disclosure of state secrets, but not for the expression of extremely unpopular and wrong headed views.  The Second Amendment is no different.  Like the First, it is the very product of an interest balancing by the people--which Justice Breyer would now conduct for them anew.  And whatever else it leaves to future evaluation, it surely elevates above  [****110] all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home. \nJustice Breyer chides us for leaving so many applications of the right to keep and bear arms in doubt, and for not providing extensive historical justification for those regulations of the right that we describe as permissible.  See post, at 720-721, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 735.  But since this case represents this Court's first in-depth examination of the Second Amendment, one should not expect it to clarify the entire field, any more than Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 25 L. Ed. 244 (1879), our first in-depth Free Exercise Clause case, left that area in a state of utter certainty.  And there will be time enough to expound upon the historical justifications for the exceptions we have mentioned if and when those exceptions come before us. \nIn sum, we hold that the District's ban on handgun possession in the home violates the Second Amendment, as [**2822]  does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense.  Assuming that Heller is not disqualified from the exercise of Second Amendment rights, the District must permit him to register  [***684] his handgun and must issue  [****111] him a license to carry it in the home. \n*   *   * \n [*636]  We are aware of the problem of handgun violence in this country, and we take seriously the concerns raised by the many amici who believe that prohibition of handgun ownership is a solution.  HN26[] LEdHN[26][] [26] The Constitution leaves the District of Columbia a variety of tools for combating that problem, including some measures regulating handguns, see supra, at 626-627, and n. 26, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 678.  But the enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table.  These include the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self-defense in the home.  Undoubtedly some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our Nation, where well-trained police forces provide personal security, and where gun violence is a serious problem.  That is perhaps debatable, but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct. \nWe affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. \nIt is so ordered. \n"}

The petitioners in these cases seek to find that liberty by marrying someone of the same sex and having their marriages deemed lawful on the same terms and conditions as marriages between persons of the opposite sex.\n  [*653]  I\nThese cases come from Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, [****12]  and Tennessee, States that define marriage as a union between one  [*654]  man and one woman. See, e.g., Mich. Const., Art. I, §25; Ky. Const. §233A; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §3101.01 (Lexis 2008);  [***619]  Tenn. Const., Art. XI, §18. The petitioners are 14 same-sex couples and two men whose same-sex partners are  [*655]  deceased. The respondents are state officials responsible for enforcing the laws in question. The petitioners claim the respondents violate the Fourteenth Amendment by denying them the right to marry or to have their marriages, lawfully performed in another State, given full recognition.\n [*656]  The petitioners filed these suits in United States District Courts in their home States. Each District Court ruled in their favor. Citations to those cases are in Appendix A, infra. The respondents appealed the decisions against them to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. It consolidated the cases and reversed the judgments of the District Courts. DeBoer v. Snyder, 772 F. 3d 388 (2014). The Court of Appeals held that a State has no constitutional obligation to license same-sex marriages or to recognize same-sex marriages performed out of State.\nThe petitioners sought certiorari. This Court granted review, limited to two questions. 574 U.S. 1118, 135 S. Ct. 1039; 190 L. Ed. 2d 908 (2015). The first, presented by the cases from Michigan and Kentucky, is whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to license a marriage [****13]  between two people of the same sex. The second, presented by the cases from Ohio, Tennessee, and, again, Kentucky, is whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to recognize a same-sex marriage licensed and performed in a State which does grant that right.\nII\n Before addressing the principles and precedents that govern these cases, it is appropriate to note the history of the subject now before the Court.\nA\nFrom their beginning to their most recent page, the annals of human history  [**2594]  reveal the transcendent importance of marriage. The lifelong union of a man and a woman always has promised nobility and dignity to all persons, without regard to their station in life. Marriage is sacred to those who live by their religions and offers unique fulfillment to those who  [*657]  find meaning in the secular realm. Its dynamic allows two people to find a life that could not be found alone, for a marriage becomes greater than just the two persons. Rising from the most basic human needs, marriage is essential to our most profound hopes and aspirations.\nThe centrality of marriage to the human condition makes it unsurprising that the institution has existed for millennia and across civilizations. Since the dawn of history, [****14]  marriage has transformed strangers into relatives, binding families and societies together. Confucius taught that marriage lies at the foundation of government. 2 Li Chi: Book of Rites 266 (C. Chai & W. Chai eds., J. Legge transl. 1967). This wisdom was echoed centuries later and half a world away by Cicero, who wrote, “The first bond of society is marriage; next, children; and then the family.” See De Officiis 57 (W. Miller transl. 1913). There are untold references to the beauty of marriage in religious and philosophical texts spanning time, cultures, and faiths, as well as in art and literature in all their forms. It is fair and necessary to say these references were based on the understanding that marriage is a union between two persons of the opposite sex.\n [***620]  That history is the beginning of these cases. The respondents say it should be the end as well. To them, it would demean a timeless institution if the concept and lawful status of marriage were extended to two persons of the same sex. Marriage, in their view, is by its nature a gender-differentiated union of man and woman. This view long has been held—and continues to be held—in good faith by reasonable and sincere people here [****15]  and throughout the world.\nThe petitioners acknowledge this history but contend that these cases cannot end there. Were their intent to demean the revered idea and reality of marriage, the petitioners’ claims would be of a different order. But that is neither their purpose nor their submission. To the contrary, it is the enduring importance of marriage that underlies the petitioners’ contentions. This, they say, is their whole point.  [*658]  Far from seeking to devalue marriage, the petitioners seek it for themselves because of their respect—and need—for its privileges and responsibilities. And their immutable nature dictates that same-sex marriage is their only real path to this profound commitment.\nRecounting the circumstances of three of these cases illustrates the urgency of the petitioners’ cause from their perspective. Petitioner James Obergefell, a plaintiff in the Ohio case, met John Arthur over two decades ago. They fell in love and started a life together, establishing a lasting, committed relation. In 2011, however, Arthur was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. This debilitating disease is progressive, with no known cure. Two years ago, Obergefell and Arthur decided [****16]  to commit to one another, resolving to marry before Arthur died. To fulfill their mutual promise, they traveled from Ohio to Maryland, where same-sex marriage was legal. It was difficult for Arthur to move, and so the couple were wed inside a medical transport plane as it remained on the tarmac in Baltimore. Three months later, Arthur died. Ohio law does not permit Obergefell to be listed as the surviving spouse on Arthur’s death certificate. By statute, they must remain strangers even in death, a state-imposed separation Obergefell deems “hurtful for  [**2595]  the rest of time.” App. in No. 14-556 etc., p. 38. He brought suit to be shown as the surviving spouse on Arthur’s death certificate.\nApril DeBoer and Jayne Rowse are co-plaintiffs in the case from Michigan. They celebrated a commitment ceremony to honor their permanent relation in 2007. They both work as nurses, DeBoer in a neonatal unit and Rowse in an emergency unit. In 2009, DeBoer and Rowse fostered and then adopted a baby boy. Later that same year, they welcomed another son into their family. The new baby, born prematurely and abandoned by his biological mother, required around-the-clock care. The next year, a baby girl with special [****17]  needs joined their family. Michigan, however, permits  [*659]  only opposite-sex married couples or single individuals to adopt, so each child can have only one woman as his or her legal parent. If an emergency were to arise, schools and hospitals may treat the three children as if they had only one parent. And, were tragedy to befall either DeBoer or Rowse, the other would have no legal rights over the children she had not been permitted to adopt. This couple seeks relief from the continuing uncertainty their unmarried status creates in their lives.\nArmy Reserve Sergeant First Class  [***621]  Ijpe DeKoe and his partner Thomas Kostura, co-plaintiffs in the Tennessee case, fell in love. In 2011, DeKoe received orders to deploy to Afghanistan. Before leaving, he and Kostura married in New York. A week later, DeKoe began his deployment, which lasted for almost a year. When he returned, the two settled in Tennessee, where DeKoe works full-time for the Army Reserve. Their lawful marriage is stripped from them whenever they reside in Tennessee, returning and disappearing as they travel across state lines. DeKoe, who served this Nation to preserve the freedom the Constitution protects, must endure a substantial [****18]  burden.\nThe cases now before the Court involve other petitioners as well, each with their own experiences. Their stories reveal that they seek not to denigrate marriage but rather to live their lives, or honor their spouses’ memory, joined by its bond.\nB\nThe ancient origins of marriage confirm its centrality, but it has not stood in isolation from developments in law and society. The history of marriage is one of both continuity and change. That institution—even as confined to opposite-sex relations—has evolved over time.\nFor example, marriage was once viewed as an arrangement by the couple’s parents based on political, religious, and financial concerns; but by the time of the Nation’s founding it was understood to be a voluntary contract between a man  [*660]  and a woman. See N. Cott, Public Vows: A History of Marriage and the Nation 9-17 (2000); S. Coontz, Marriage, A History 15-16 (2005). As the role and status of women changed, the institution further evolved. Under the centuries-old doctrine of coverture, a married man and woman were treated by the State as a single, male-dominated legal entity. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 430 (1765). As women gained legal, political, [****19]  and property rights, and as society began to understand that women have their own equal dignity, the law of coverture was abandoned. See Brief for Historians of Marriage et al. as Amici Curiae 16-19. These and other developments in the institution of marriage over the past centuries were not mere superficial changes. Rather, they worked deep transformations in its structure, affecting aspects of marriage long viewed by many as essential. See generally N. Cott, Public Vows; S. Coontz, Marriage; H.  [**2596]  Hartog, Man & Wife in America: A History (2000).\nThese new insights have strengthened, not weakened, the institution of marriage. Indeed, changed understandings of marriage are characteristic of a Nation where new dimensions of freedom become apparent to new generations, often through perspectives that begin in pleas or protests and then are considered in the political sphere and the judicial process.\nThis dynamic can be seen in the Nation’s experiences with the rights of gays and lesbians. Until the mid-20th century, same-sex intimacy long had been condemned as immoral by the state itself in most Western nations, a belief often embodied in the criminal law. For this reason, among others, many [****20]  persons did not deem homosexuals to have dignity in their own distinct identity. A truthful declaration by same-sex couples of what was in their hearts had to remain unspoken. Even when a greater awareness  [***622]  of the humanity and integrity of homosexual persons came in the period after World War II, the argument that gays and lesbians had a just claim to dignity was in conflict with both law and widespread  [*661]  social conventions. Same-sex intimacy remained a crime in many States. Gays and lesbians were prohibited from most government employment, barred from military service, excluded under immigration laws, targeted by police, and burdened in their rights to associate. See Brief for Organization of American Historians as Amicus Curiae 5-28.\nFor much of the 20th century, moreover, homosexuality was treated as an illness. When the American Psychiatric Association published the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1952, homosexuality was classified as a mental disorder, a position adhered to until 1973. See Position Statement on Homosexuality and Civil Rights, 1973, in 131 Am. J. Psychiatry 497 (1974). Only in more recent years have psychiatrists and others recognized that sexual orientation is both [****21]  a normal expression of human sexuality and immutable. See Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as Amici Curiae 7-17.\nIn the late 20th century, following substantial cultural and political developments, same-sex couples began to lead more open and public lives and to establish families. This development was followed by a quite extensive discussion of the issue in both governmental and private sectors and by a shift in public attitudes toward greater tolerance. As a result, questions about the rights of gays and lesbians soon reached the courts, where the issue could be discussed in the formal discourse of the law.\nThis Court first gave detailed consideration to the legal status of homosexuals in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 106 S. Ct. 2841, 92 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1986). There it upheld the constitutionality of a Georgia law deemed to criminalize certain homosexual acts. Ten years later, in Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 116 S. Ct. 1620, 134 L. Ed. 2d 855 (1996), the Court invalidated an amendment to Colorado’s Constitution that sought to foreclose any branch or political subdivision of the State from protecting persons against discrimination based on sexual orientation. Then, in 2003, the Court overruled  [*662]  Bowers, holding that laws making same-sex intimacy a crime “demea[n] the lives of homosexual persons.” Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 575, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508.\nAgainst this background, [****22]  the legal question of same-sex marriage arose. In 1993, the Hawaii Supreme Court held Hawaii’s law restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples constituted a classification on the basis of sex and was therefore subject to  [**2597]  strict scrutiny under the Hawaii Constitution. Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 852 P. 2d 44. Although this decision did not mandate that same-sex marriage be allowed, some States were concerned by its implications and reaffirmed in their laws that marriage is defined as a union between opposite-sex partners. So too in 1996, Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 110 Stat. 2419, defining marriage for all federal-law purposes as “only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife.” 1 U.S.C. §7.\nThe new and widespread discussion of the subject led other States to a different conclusion. In 2003, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts  [***623]  held the State’s Constitution guaranteed same-sex couples the right to marry. See Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, 440 Mass. 309, 798 N. E. 2d 941 (2003). After that ruling, some additional States granted marriage rights to same-sex couples, either through judicial or legislative processes. These decisions and statutes are cited in Appendix B, infra. Two Terms ago, in United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 186 L. Ed. 2d 808 (2013), this Court invalidated DOMA to the extent it barred the [****23]  Federal Government from treating same-sex marriages as valid even when they were lawful in the State where they were licensed. DOMA, the Court held, impermissibly disparaged those same-sex couples “who wanted to affirm their commitment to one another before their children, their family, their friends, and their community.” Id., at 764, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 186 L. Ed. 2d at 823.\n Numerous cases about same-sex marriage have reached the United States Courts of Appeals in recent years. In accordance with the judicial duty to base their decisions on  [*663]  principled reasons and neutral discussions, without scornful or disparaging commentary, courts have written a substantial body of law considering all sides of these issues. That case law helps to explain and formulate the underlying principles this Court now must consider. With the exception of the opinion here under review and one other, see Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning, 455 F. 3d 859, 864-868 (CA8 2006), the Courts of Appeals have held that excluding same-sex couples from marriage violates the Constitution. There also have been many thoughtful District Court decisions addressing same-sex marriage—and most of them, too, have concluded same-sex couples must be allowed to marry. In addition the highest courts of many States have contributed to this ongoing dialogue [****24]  in decisions interpreting their own State Constitutions. These state and federal judicial opinions are cited in Appendix A, infra.\nAfter years of litigation, legislation, referenda, and the discussions that attended these public acts, the States are now divided on the issue of same-sex marriage. See Office of the Atty. Gen. of Maryland, The State of Marriage Equality in America, State-by-State Supp. (2015).\nIII\nHN2[] LEdHN[2][] [2] Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, no State shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” The fundamental liberties protected by this Clause include most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights. See Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 147-149, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1968). In addition these liberties extend to certain personal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices that define personal identity and beliefs. See, e.g.,  [**2598] Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 453, 92 S. Ct. 1029, 31 L. Ed. 2d  349 (1972); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 484-486, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965).\nHN3[] LEdHN[3][] [3] The identification and protection of fundamental rights is an enduring part of the judicial duty to interpret the Constitution. That responsibility, however, “has not been reduced  [*664]  to any formula.” Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 542, 81 S. Ct. 1752, 6 L. Ed. 2d 989 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting). Rather, it requires courts to exercise  [***624]  reasoned judgment in identifying interests of the person so fundamental that the State must accord them its respect. See [****25]  ibid. That process is guided by many of the same considerations relevant to analysis of other constitutional provisions that set forth broad principles rather than specific requirements. History and tradition guide and discipline this inquiry but do not set its outer boundaries. See Lawrence, supra, at 572, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508. That method respects our history and learns from it without allowing the past alone to rule the present.\nHN4[] LEdHN[4][] [4] The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution’s central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.\nApplying these established tenets, the Court has long held HN5[] LEdHN[5][] [5] the right to marry is protected by the Constitution. In Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1010 (1967), which invalidated bans on interracial unions, a unanimous Court held marriage is “one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.” The Court reaffirmed [****26]  that holding in Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 384, 98 S. Ct. 673, 54 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1978), which held the right to marry was burdened by a law prohibiting fathers who were behind on child support from marrying. The Court again applied this principle in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 95, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 96 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1987), which held the right to marry was abridged by regulations limiting the privilege of prison inmates to marry. Over time and in other contexts, the Court has reiterated that the right to marry is fundamental under the Due Process Clause. See, e.g., M. L. B. v. S. L. J., 519 U.S. 102, 116, 117 S. Ct. 555, 136 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1996); Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. LaFleur,  [*665]  414 U.S. 632, 639-640, 94 S. Ct. 791, 39 L. Ed. 2d 52 (1974); Griswold, supra, at 486, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 541, 62 S. Ct. 1110, 86 L. Ed. 1655 (1942); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed. 1042 (1923).\nIt cannot be denied that this Court’s cases describing the right to marry presumed a relationship involving opposite-sex partners. The Court, like many institutions, has made assumptions defined by the world and time of which it is a part. This was evident in Baker v. Nelson, 409 U.S. 810, 93 S. Ct. 37, 34 L. Ed. 2d 65, a one-line summary decision issued in 1972, holding the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage did not present a substantial federal question.\nStill, there are other, more instructive precedents. This Court’s cases have expressed constitutional principles of broader reach. In defining the right to marry these cases have identified essential attributes of that right based in history, tradition, and other constitutional liberties inherent in this intimate bond. See, e.g.,  [**2599]  Lawrence, 539 U.S., at 574, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508; Turner, supra, at 95, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 96 L. Ed. 2d 64; Zablocki, supra [****27] , at 384, 98 S. Ct. 673, 54 L. Ed. 2d 618; Loving,  [***625]  supra, at 12, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1010; Griswold, supra, at 486, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510. And in assessing whether the force and rationale of its cases apply to same-sex couples, the Court must respect the basic reasons why the right to marry has been long protected. See, e.g., Eisenstadt, supra, at 453-454, 92 S. Ct. 1029, 31 L. Ed. 2d 349; Poe, supra, at 542-553, 81 S. Ct. 1752, 6 L. Ed. 2d 989 (Harlan, J., dissenting).\nThis analysis compels the conclusion that HN6[] LEdHN[6][] [6] same-sex couples may exercise the right to marry. The four principles and traditions to be discussed demonstrate that the reasons marriage is fundamental under the Constitution apply with equal force to same-sex couples.\n A first premise of the Court’s relevant precedents is that HN7[] LEdHN[7][] [7] the right to personal choice regarding marriage is inherent in the concept of individual autonomy. This abiding connection between marriage and liberty is why Loving invalidated interracial marriage bans under the Due Process Clause. See 388 U.S., at 12, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1010; see also Zablocki, supra, at 384, 98 S. Ct. 673, 54 L. Ed. 2d 618 (observing Loving held “the right to marry is of fundamental importance  [*666]  for all individuals”). Like choices concerning contraception, family relationships, procreation, and childrearing, all of which are protected by the Constitution, decisions concerning marriage are among the most intimate that an individual can make. See Lawrence, supra, at 574, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508. Indeed, the Court has [****28]  noted it would be contradictory “to recognize a right of privacy with respect to other matters of family life and not with respect to the decision to enter the relationship that is the foundation of the family in our society.” Zablocki, supra, at 386, 98 S. Ct. 673, 54 L. Ed. 2d 618.\nChoices about marriage shape an individual’s destiny. As the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has explained, because “it fulfils yearnings for security, safe haven, and connection that express our common humanity, civil marriage is an esteemed institution, and the decision whether and whom to marry is among life’s momentous acts of self-definition.” Goodridge, 440 Mass., at 322, 798 N. E. 2d, at 955.\nThe nature of marriage is that, through its enduring bond, two persons together can find other freedoms, such as expression, intimacy, and spirituality. This is true for all persons, whatever their sexual orientation. See Windsor, 570 U.S., at 770 -772, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 186 L. Ed. 2d at 828. There is dignity in the bond between two men or two women who seek to marry and in their autonomy to make such profound choices. Cf. Loving, supra, at 12, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1010 (“[T]he freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State”).\nA second principle in this Court’s jurisprudence is that the right to marry is fundamental because it [****29]  supports a two-person union unlike any other in its importance to the committed individuals. This point was central to Griswold v. Connecticut, which held the Constitution protects the right of married couples to use contraception. 381 U.S., at 485, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510. Suggesting that marriage is a right “older than the Bill of Rights,” Griswold described marriage this way:\n [*667]   [***626]  “Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose  [**2600]  as any involved in our prior decisions. ” Id., at 486, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510.\nAnd in Turner, the Court again acknowledged the intimate association protected by this right, holding prisoners could not be denied the right to marry because their committed relationships satisfied the basic reasons why marriage is a fundamental right. See 482 U.S., at 95-96, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 96 L. Ed. 2d 64. The right to marry thus dignifies couples who “wish to define themselves by their commitment to each other.” Windsor, supra, at 763, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 186 L. Ed. 2d at 823. Marriage responds to the universal fear that a lonely person might call out only to find no one there. It offers the hope of companionship [****30]  and understanding and assurance that while both still live there will be someone to care for the other.\nHN8[] LEdHN[8][] [8] As this Court held in Lawrence, same-sex couples have the same right as opposite-sex couples to enjoy intimate association. Lawrence invalidated laws that made same-sex intimacy a criminal act. And it acknowledged that “[w]hen sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring.” 539 U.S., at 567, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508. But while Lawrence confirmed a dimension of freedom that allows individuals to engage in intimate association without criminal liability, it does not follow that freedom stops there. Outlaw to outcast may be a step forward, but it does not achieve the full promise of liberty.\nHN9[] LEdHN[9][] [9] A third basis for protecting the right to marry is that it safeguards children and families and thus draws meaning from related rights of childrearing, procreation, and education. See Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S. Ct. 571, 69 L. Ed. 1070 (1925);  [*668]  Meyer, 262 U.S., at 399, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed. 1042. The Court has recognized these connections by describing the varied rights as a unified whole: “[T]he right to ‘marry, establish a home and bring up children’ is a central part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.” Zablocki, 434 U.S., at 384, 98 S. Ct. 673, 54 L. Ed. 2d 618 (quoting Meyer, supra, at 399, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed. 1042). Under the laws of the several [****31]  States, some of marriage’s protections for children and families are material. But marriage also confers more profound benefits. By giving recognition and legal structure to their parents’ relationship, marriage allows children “to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.” Windsor, supra, at 772, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 186 L. Ed. 2d at 828. Marriage also affords the permanency and stability important to children’s best interests. See Brief for Scholars of the Constitutional Rights of Children as Amici Curiae 22-27.\nAs all parties agree, many same-sex couples provide loving and nurturing homes to their children, whether biological or adopted. And hundreds of thousands of children are presently being raised by such couples. See Brief for Gary J. Gates as Amicus Curiae 4. Most States have allowed  [***627]  gays and lesbians to adopt, either as individuals or as couples, and many adopted and foster children have same-sex parents, see id., at 5. This provides powerful confirmation from the law itself that gays and lesbians can create loving, supportive families.\nExcluding same-sex couples from marriage thus conflicts with a central premise of the right to marry. Without [****32]  the recognition, stability, and predictability marriage offers, their children suffer the stigma of knowing their families are somehow lesser. They also suffer the significant material costs of being raised by unmarried parents, relegated through no fault of their own to a more difficult and uncertain family life. The marriage laws at issue  [**2601]  here thus harm and humiliate the children of same-sex couples. See Windsor, supra, at 772, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 186 L. Ed. 2d at 828.\n [*669]  That is not to say the right to marry is less meaningful for those who do not or cannot have children. HN10[] LEdHN[10][] [10] An ability, desire, or promise to procreate is not and has not been a prerequisite for a valid marriage in any State. In light of precedent protecting the right of a married couple not to procreate, it cannot be said the Court or the States have conditioned the right to marry on the capacity or commitment to procreate. The constitutional marriage right has many aspects, of which childbearing is only one.\nFourth and finally, this Court’s cases and the Nation’s traditions make clear that marriage is a keystone of our social order. Alexis de Tocqueville recognized this truth on his travels through the United States almost two centuries ago:\n“There is certainly no country in the world [****33]  where the tie of marriage is so much respected as in America . . . [W]hen the American retires from the turmoil of public life to the bosom of his family, he finds in it the image of order and of peace . . . . [H]e afterwards carries [that image] with him into public affairs.” 1 Democracy in America 309 (H. Reeve transl., rev. ed. 1990).\nIn Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190, 211, 8 S. Ct. 723, 31 L. Ed. 654 (1888), the Court echoed de Tocqueville, explaining that marriage is “the foundation of the family and of society, without which there would be neither civilization nor progress.” Marriage, the Maynard Court said, has long been “‘a great public institution, giving character to our whole civil polity.’” Id., at 213, 8 S. Ct. 723, 31 L. Ed. 654. This idea has been reiterated even as the institution has evolved in substantial ways over time, superseding rules related to parental consent, gender, and race once thought by many to be essential. See generally N. Cott, Public Vows. Marriage remains a building block of our national community.\nFor that reason, just as a couple vows to support each other, so does society pledge to support the couple, offering symbolic recognition and material benefits to protect and nourish the union. Indeed, while the States are in general  [*670]  free to vary the benefits they confer [****34]  on all married couples, they have throughout our history made marriage the basis for an expanding list of governmental rights, benefits, and responsibilities. These aspects of marital status include: taxation; inheritance and property rights; rules of intestate succession; spousal privilege in the law of evidence; hospital access; medical decisionmaking authority; adoption rights; the rights and benefits of survivors; birth and death certificates;  [***628]  professional ethics rules; campaign finance restrictions; workers’ compensation benefits; health insurance; and child custody, support, and visitation rules. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 6-9; Brief for American Bar Association as Amicus Curiae 8-29. Valid marriage under state law is also a significant status for over a thousand provisions of federal law. See Windsor, 570 U.S., at 765, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 186 L. Ed. 2d at 824. The States have contributed to the fundamental character of the marriage right by placing that institution at the center of so many facets of the legal and social order.\nThere is no difference between same- and opposite-sex couples with respect to this principle. Yet by virtue of their exclusion from that institution, same-sex couples are denied the constellation of [****35]  benefits that the States have linked to marriage. This harm results in more than just material burdens. Same-sex couples are consigned to an instability many opposite-sex couples would deem intolerable in their own lives. As the State itself makes  [**2602]  marriage all the more precious by the significance it attaches to it, exclusion from that status has the effect of teaching that gays and lesbians are unequal in important respects. It demeans gays and lesbians for the State to lock them out of a central institution of the Nation’s society. Same-sex couples, too, may aspire to the transcendent purposes of marriage and seek fulfillment in its highest meaning.\nThe limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples may long have seemed natural and just, but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is  [*671]  now manifest. With that knowledge must come the recognition that laws excluding same-sex couples from the marriage right impose stigma and injury of the kind prohibited by our basic charter.\nObjecting that this does not reflect an appropriate framing of the issue, the respondents refer to Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1997), which called for a “‘careful description’” of fundamental rights. They assert [****36]  the petitioners do not seek to exercise the right to marry but rather a new and nonexistent “right to same-sex marriage.” Brief for Respondent in No. 14-556, p. 8. HN11[] LEdHN[11][] [11] Glucksberg did insist that liberty under the Due Process Clause must be defined in a most circumscribed manner, with central reference to specific historical practices. Yet while that approach may have been appropriate for the asserted right there involved (physician-assisted suicide), it is inconsistent with the approach this Court has used in discussing other fundamental rights, including marriage and intimacy. Loving did not ask about a “right to interracial marriage”; Turner did not ask about a “right of inmates to marry”; and Zablocki did not ask about a “right of fathers with unpaid child support duties to marry.” Rather, each case inquired about the right to marry in its comprehensive sense, asking if there was a sufficient justification for excluding the relevant class from the right. See also Glucksberg, 521 U.S., at 752-773, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 789-792, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgments).\nThat principle applies here. If rights were defined by who exercised them in the past, then received practices could serve as their own continued  [***629]  justification [****37]  and new groups could not invoke rights once denied. This Court has rejected that approach, both with respect to the right to marry and the rights of gays and lesbians. See Loving, 388 U.S., at 12, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1010; Lawrence, 539 U.S., at 566-567, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508.\nThe right to marry is fundamental as a matter of history and tradition, but rights come not from ancient sources alone. They rise, too, from a better informed understanding of how  [*672]  constitutional imperatives define a liberty that remains urgent in our own era. Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here. But when that sincere, personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied. Under the Constitution, same-sex couples seek in marriage the same legal treatment as opposite-sex couples, and it would disparage their choices and diminish their personhood to deny them this right.\nHN12[] LEdHN[12][] [12] The right of same-sex couples to marry that is part of the liberty promised by the Fourteenth Amendment is derived, too, from that Amendment’s guarantee of [****38]  the equal protection of the laws. The Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause  [**2603]  are connected in a profound way, though they set forth independent principles. Rights implicit in liberty and rights secured by equal protection may rest on different precepts and are not always coextensive, yet in some instances each may be instructive as to the meaning and reach of the other. In any particular case one Clause may be thought to capture the essence of the right in a more accurate and comprehensive way, even as the two Clauses may converge in the identification and definition of the right. See M. L. B., 519 U.S., at 120-121, 117 S. Ct. 555, 136 L. Ed. 2d 473; id., at 128-129, 117 S. Ct. 555, 136 L. Ed. 2d 473 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 665, 103 S. Ct. 2064, 76 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1983). This interrelation of the two principles furthers our understanding of what freedom is and must become.\nThe Court’s cases touching upon the right to marry reflect this dynamic. In Loving the Court invalidated a prohibition on interracial marriage under both the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause. The Court first declared the prohibition invalid because of its unequal treatment  [*673]  of interracial couples. It stated: “There can be no doubt that restricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.” 388 U.S., at 12, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1010. With this link to equal protection the Court proceeded to hold [****39]  the prohibition offended central precepts of liberty: “To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State’s citizens of liberty without due process of law.” Ibid. The reasons why marriage is a fundamental right became more clear and compelling from a full awareness  [***630]  and understanding of the hurt that resulted from laws barring interracial unions.\nThe synergy between the two protections is illustrated further in Zablocki. There the Court invoked the Equal Protection Clause as its basis for invalidating the challenged law, which, as already noted, barred fathers who were behind on child-support payments from marrying without judicial approval. The equal protection analysis depended in central part on the Court’s holding that the law burdened a right “of fundamental importance.” 434 U.S., at 383, 98 S. Ct. 673, 54 L. Ed. 2d 618. It was the essential nature of the marriage right, discussed at length in Zablocki, see id., at 383-387, 98 S. Ct. 673, 54 L. Ed. 2d 618, that made apparent the law’s incompatibility with requirements of equality. Each concept—liberty and equal protection—leads to a stronger understanding [****40]  of the other.\nIndeed, HN13[] LEdHN[13][] [13] in interpreting the Equal Protection Clause, the Court has recognized that new insights and societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality within our most fundamental institutions that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged. To take but one period, this occurred with respect to marriage in the 1970’s and 1980’s. Notwithstanding the gradual erosion of the doctrine of coverture, see supra, at 6, invidious sex-based classifications in marriage remained  [*674]  common through the mid-20th century. See App. to Brief for Appellant in Reed v. Reed, O. T. 1971, No. 70-4, pp. 69-88 (an extensive reference to laws extant as of 1971 treating women as unequal to men in marriage). These classifications denied the equal dignity of men and women. One State’s law, for example, provided in 1971 that “the husband is the head of the family and the wife is subject to him; her legal civil existence is merged in the husband, except so far as the law recognizes her  [**2604]  separately, either for her own protection, or for her benefit.” Ga. Code Ann. §53-501 (1935). Responding to a new awareness, the Court invoked equal protection principles to invalidate laws imposing sex-based inequality on marriage. See, e.g., Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U.S. 455, 101 S. Ct. 1195, 67 L. Ed. 2d 428 (1981); Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 100 S. Ct. 1540, 64 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1980); Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.S. 76, 99 S. Ct. 2655, 61 L. Ed. 2d 382 (1979); Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 99 S. Ct. 1102, 59 L. Ed. 2d 306 (1979); Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, 97 S. Ct. 1021, 51 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1977) (plurality [****41]  opinion); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 95 S. Ct. 1225, 43 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1975); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 93 S. Ct. 1764, 36 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1973). Like Loving and Zablocki, these precedents show HN14[] LEdHN[14][] [14] the Equal Protection Clause can help to identify and correct inequalities in the institution of marriage, vindicating precepts of liberty and equality under the Constitution.\nOther cases confirm this relation between liberty and equality. In M. L. B. v. S. L. J., the Court invalidated under due process and equal protection principles a statute requiring indigent mothers to pay a fee in order to appeal the termination of their parental rights. See 519 U.S., at 119-124, 117 S. Ct. 555, 136 L. Ed. 2d 473. In Eisenstadt  v. Baird, the Court invoked both principles to invalidate a prohibition on the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons but not married persons. See 405 U.S., at 446-454, 92 S. Ct. 1029, 31 L. Ed. 2d  [***631]  349. And in Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, the Court invalidated under both principles a law that allowed sterilization of habitual criminals. See 316 U.S., at 538-543, 62 S. Ct. 1110, 86 L. Ed. 1655.\nIn Lawrence, the Court acknowledged the interlocking nature of these constitutional safeguards in the context of the  [*675]  legal treatment of gays and lesbians. See 539 U.S., at 575, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508. Although Lawrence elaborated its holding under the Due Process Clause, it acknowledged, and sought to remedy, the continuing inequality that resulted from laws making intimacy in the lives of gays and lesbians a crime against the State. [****42]  See ibid. Lawrence therefore drew upon principles of liberty and equality to define and protect the rights of gays and lesbians, holding the State “cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.” Id., at 578, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508.\nThis dynamic also applies to same-sex marriage. It is now clear that the challenged laws burden the liberty of same-sex couples, and it must be further acknowledged that they abridge central precepts of equality. Here the marriage laws enforced by the respondents are in essence unequal: Same-sex couples are denied all the benefits afforded to opposite-sex couples and are barred from exercising a fundamental right. Especially against a long history of disapproval of their relationships, this denial to same-sex couples of the right to marry works a grave and continuing harm. The imposition of this disability on gays and lesbians serves to disrespect and subordinate them. And the Equal Protection Clause, like the Due Process Clause, prohibits this unjustified infringement of the fundamental right to marry. See, e.g., Zablocki, supra, at 383-388, 98 S. Ct. 673, 54 L. Ed. 2d 618; Skinner, 316 U.S., at 541, 62 S. Ct. 1110, 86 L. Ed. 1655.\nThese considerations lead to the conclusion that HN15[] LEdHN[15][] [15] the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and under the [****43]  Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty. The Court now holds that  [**2605]  same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be denied to them. Baker v. Nelson must be and now is overruled, and the state laws challenged by the petitioners in these cases are now held invalid to the extent they exclude  [*676]  same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples.\nIV\nThere may be an initial inclination in these cases to proceed with caution—to await further legislation, litigation, and debate. The respondents warn there has been insufficient democratic discourse before deciding an issue so basic as the definition of marriage. In its ruling on the cases now before this Court, the majority opinion for the Court of Appeals made a cogent argument that it would be appropriate for the respondents’ States to await further public discussion and political measures before licensing same-sex marriages. See DeBoer, 772 F. 3d, at 409.\nYet there has been far more deliberation than this argument acknowledges. There have been referenda, legislative debates, and grassroots  [***632]  campaigns, as well as countless studies, papers, [****44]  books, and other popular and scholarly writings. There has been extensive litigation in state and federal courts. See Appendix A, infra. Judicial opinions addressing the issue have been informed by the contentions of parties and counsel, which, in turn, reflect the more general, societal discussion of same-sex marriage and its meaning that has occurred over the past decades. As more than 100 amici make clear in their filings, many of the central institutions in American life—state and local governments, the military, large and small businesses, labor unions, religious organizations, law enforcement, civic groups, professional organizations, and universities—have devoted substantial attention to the question. This has led to an enhanced understanding of the issue—an understanding reflected in the arguments now presented for resolution as a matter of constitutional law.\nOf course,HN16[] LEdHN[16][] [16] the Constitution contemplates that democracy is the appropriate process for change, so long as that process does not abridge fundamental rights. Last Term, a plurality of this Court reaffirmed the importance of the democratic  [*677]  principle in Schuette v. BAMN, 572 U.S. 291, 134 S. Ct. 1623, 188 L. Ed. 2d 613 (2014), noting the “right of citizens to debate so they can learn and decide [****45]  and then, through the political process, act in concert to try to shape the course of their own times.” Id., at 312, 134 S. Ct. 1623, 188 L. Ed. 2d at 628. Indeed, it is most often through democracy that liberty is preserved and protected in our lives. But as Schuette also said, “[t]he freedom secured by the Constitution consists, in one of its essential dimensions, of the right of the individual not to be injured by the unlawful exercise of governmental power.” Id., at 311, 134 S. Ct. 1623, 188 L. Ed. 2d at 628. Thus, when the rights of persons are violated, “the Constitution requires redress by the courts,” notwithstanding the more general value of democratic decisionmaking. Id., at 313, 134 S. Ct. 1623, 188 L. Ed. 2d at 628. This holds true even when protecting individual rights affects issues of the utmost importance and sensitivity.\nHN17[] LEdHN[17][] [17] The dynamic of our constitutional system is that individuals need not await legislative action before asserting a fundamental right. The Nation’s courts are open to injured individuals who come to them to vindicate their own direct, personal stake in our basic charter. An individual can invoke a right to constitutional protection when he or she is harmed, even if the broader public disagrees and even if the legislature refuses to act. The idea of  [**2606]  the Constitution “was to withdraw certain subjects from [****46]  the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.” West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 638, 63 S. Ct. 1178, 87 L. Ed. 1628 (1943). This is why “fundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.” Ibid. It is of no moment whether advocates of same-sex marriage now enjoy or lack momentum in the democratic process. The issue before the Court here is the legal question whether the Constitution protects the right of same-sex couples to marry.\nThis is not the first time the Court has been asked to adopt a cautious approach to recognizing and protecting fundamental rights. In Bowers, a bare majority upheld a law criminalizing  [***633]   [*678]  same-sex intimacy. See 478 U.S., at 186, 190-195, 106 S. Ct. 2841, 92 L. Ed. 2d 140. That approach might have been viewed as a cautious endorsement of the democratic process, which had only just begun to consider the rights of gays and lesbians. Yet, in effect, Bowers upheld state action that denied gays and lesbians a fundamental right and caused them pain and humiliation. As evidenced by the dissents in that case, the facts and principles necessary to a correct holding were known to the Bowers Court. See id., at 199, 106 S. Ct. 2841, 92 L. Ed. 2d 140 (Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan [****47] , Marshall, and Stevens, JJ., dissenting); id., at 214, 106 S. Ct. 2841, 92 L. Ed. 2d 140 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ., dissenting). That is why Lawrence held Bowers was “not correct when it was decided.” 539 U.S., at 578, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508. Although Bowers was eventually repudiated in Lawrence, men and women were harmed in the interim, and the substantial effects of these injuries no doubt lingered long after Bowers was overruled. Dignitary wounds cannot always be healed with the stroke of a pen.\nA ruling against same-sex couples would have the same effect—and, like Bowers, would be unjustified under the Fourteenth Amendment. The petitioners’ stories make clear the urgency of the issue they present to the Court. James Obergefell now asks whether Ohio can erase his marriage to John Arthur for all time. April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse now ask whether Michigan may continue to deny them the certainty and stability all mothers desire to protect their children, and for them and their children the childhood years will pass all too soon. Ijpe DeKoe and Thomas Kostura now ask whether Tennessee can deny to one who has served this Nation the basic dignity of recognizing his New York marriage. Properly presented with the petitioners’ cases, the Court has a duty to address [****48]  these claims and answer these questions.\nIndeed, faced with a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals—a disagreement that caused impermissible geographic variation in the meaning of federal law—the Court granted review to determine whether same-sex couples may  [*679]  exercise the right to marry. Were the Court to uphold the challenged laws as constitutional, it would teach the Nation that these laws are in accord with our society’s most basic compact. Were the Court to stay its hand to allow slower, case-by-case determination of the required availability of specific public benefits to same-sex couples, it still would deny gays and lesbians many rights and responsibilities intertwined with marriage.\nThe respondents also argue allowing same-sex couples to wed will harm marriage as an institution by leading to fewer opposite-sex marriages. This may occur, the respondents contend, because licensing same-sex marriage severs the connection  [**2607]  between natural procreation and marriage. That argument, however, rests on a counterintuitive view of opposite-sex couple’s decisionmaking processes regarding marriage and parenthood. Decisions about whether to marry and raise children are based on many personal, [****49]  romantic, and practical considerations; and it is unrealistic to conclude that an opposite-sex couple would choose not to marry simply because same-sex couples may do so. See Kitchen v. Herbert, 755 F. 3d 1193, 1223 (CA10 2014) (“[I]t is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition  [***634]  of the love and commitment between same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples”). The respondents have not shown a foundation for the conclusion that allowing same-sex marriage will cause the harmful outcomes they describe. Indeed, with respect to this asserted basis for excluding same-sex couples from the right to marry, it is appropriate to observe these cases involve only the rights of two consenting adults whose marriages would pose no risk of harm to themselves or third parties.\nFinally, it must be emphasized that religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned. The First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles  [*680]  that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths, and to their own deep aspirations [****50]  to continue the family structure they have long revered. The same is true of those who oppose same-sex marriage for other reasons. In turn, those who believe allowing same-sex marriage is proper or indeed essential, whether as a matter of religious conviction or secular belief, may engage those who disagree with their view in an open and searching debate. The Constitution, however, does not permit the State to bar same-sex couples from marriage on the same terms as accorded to couples of the opposite sex.\nV\nThese cases also present the question whether the Constitution requires States to recognize same-sex marriages validly performed out of State. As made clear by the case of Obergefell and Arthur, and by that of DeKoe and Kostura, the recognition bans inflict substantial and continuing harm on same-sex couples.\nBeing married in one State but having that valid marriage denied in another is one of “the most perplexing and distressing complication[s]” in the law of domestic relations. Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287, 299, 63 S. Ct. 207, 87 L. Ed. 279 (1942) (internal quotation marks omitted). Leaving the current state of affairs in place would maintain and promote instability and uncertainty. For some couples, even an ordinary drive into a neighboring State to visit family [****51]  or friends risks causing severe hardship in the event of a spouse’s hospitalization while across state lines. In light of the fact that many States already allow same-sex marriage—and hundreds of thousands of these marriages already have occurred—the disruption caused by the recognition bans is significant and ever-growing.\nAs counsel for the respondents acknowledged at argument, if States are required by the Constitution to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, the justifications for refusing to  [*681]  recognize those marriages performed elsewhere are undermined. See Tr. of Oral Arg. on Question 2, p. 44. The Court, in this decision, holdsHN18[] LEdHN[18][] [18] same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry in all States. It  [**2608]  follows that the Court also must hold—and it now does hold—that there is no lawful basis for a State to refuse to recognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed in another State on the ground of its same-sex character.\n  [***635]  * * *\nNo union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these [****52]  cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.\nIt is so ordered.\nAPPENDICES\nA\nState and Federal Judicial Decisions\nAddressing Same-Sex Marriage\nUnited States Courts of Appeals Decisions\nAdams v.
