      "original": "In generative legal systems, speed is one objective among several—and quantization is a one-sided intervention. It optimizes speed and cost (less memory, more throughput, cheaper inference) by cannibalizing the multi-step, structured cognition that legal analysis demands. And it does this while leaving surface fluency intact, making the model seem confident even as its reasoning deteriorates."
