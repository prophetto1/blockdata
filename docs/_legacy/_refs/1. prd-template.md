## Writing Guidelines

1. **No implementation language** — Say "users can export results" not "the system calls an Edge Function"
2. **User-centric framing** — Every capability starts with what the user can do
3. **Concrete examples** — Avoid abstract descriptions; use specific scenarios
4. **Testable criteria** — Success metrics should be measurable
5. **Vision, not roadmap** — Describe the destination, not the journey
