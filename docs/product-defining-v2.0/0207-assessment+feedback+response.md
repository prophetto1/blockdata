- for example - block unit expression only becomes block unit expression + user defined grouping of blocks x user config N; so rather than a visual page showing immutable/user defined schema per block - shows 5 or 15 or 25 blocks per visual page. 

- rather than having users have to download jsonls that include all inbdividual block jsons - give me a online view similar to our view as we see in postgre..  integrate model api integration directly onto web platform, and allow users to work online directly
- rather than requiring users to have to upload pre-configured and fully-developed jsons with full enums - have them follow a visual wizard which creates it for them through a series of questions with ai assistance
- rather than doing that , oprovide a set of frequently used template user schemas - whcih can be loaded and modifed with assistance from ai to configure their own 
- the ai can examine the suer data and be helpful in a way that recommends how to set it up ... invites normal users
