We will use the folloing five canonical documents. Their scope is the following and should always remain fixed in their purpose.

**FUTURE-ORIENTED**

1. Document: PRD (product requirements document)
   Purpose: The envisioned final product — features, users, value, success criteria
   Time Orientation: Future (end state)

2. Document: PRD Technical Specification
   Purpose: How the PRD maps to architecture — tables, APIs, constraints33
   Time Orientation: Future (how to build it)

**PRESENT-ORIENTED (AS-IS)**

3. Document: Technical Spec - 'component or feature name'
   Purpose: Document defined to guide development of the component or feature. Takes as-is states of the system and prepares the next steps to proceed in the development.
   Time Orientation: Present

   Note: There will be several Technical Spec documents - one for each component or feature.

4. Document: Implementation Status - 'component or feature name'
   Purpose: What's deployed, what works, current limitations
   Time Orientation: Present (what exists now)

**PRESENT AND FUTURE**

5. Document: Roadmap
   Purpose: Aggregates all present implementation status of all components or features defined and/or ongoing in the present and also shows all future phases or steps as needed to reach the final PRD product state.

WE will be drafting final versions of doc 1 and 2 and locking them so that they can never be changed. and then using 3 and 4 and 5 to reach the final states described in 1 and 2.
