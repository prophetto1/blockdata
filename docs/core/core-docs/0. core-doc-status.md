# Core Docs Status (Snapshot)

Snapshot date: 2026-02-07

This file summarizes the current state of the **five canonical document categories** defined in:

- `docs/core/core-docs/0. core-doc-explanation.md`

The goal is to identify what is **complete vs incomplete**, and where the relevant content currently lives (including drifted/WIP files).

---

## Canonical Set (5)

### 1) PRD (Document 1) - FUTURE (end state)

**Status:** Draft reconstructed (needs review and locking).

**Current files:**
- `docs/core/core-docs/1. prd-template.md` (template / target structure)
- `docs/core/core-docs/1. prd-v1.0.md` (early draft; too thin vs template)
- `docs/core/core-docs/1. prd-v2.0-draft.md` (reconstructed PRD draft derived from existing docs)

**Drift / misfiled content:**
- `docs/_drifted/prd-v4.md` is predominantly a technical specification (data model, identity model, API, architecture). It does not match the PRD template's user-centric structure.
- `docs/core/ref/prdver-vs-intent.md` explicitly calls out this PRD vs technical-spec mismatch and is useful as guidance.

**What "done" looks like:**
- A PRD that conforms to `1. prd-template.md` (vision, problem, users, capabilities, use cases, success criteria, out-of-scope).
- PRD is then "locked" (future edits happen via Doc 3/4/5, not by mutating the PRD intent).

---

### 2) PRD Technical Specification (Document 2) - FUTURE (how to build it)

**Status:** Partially complete (strong draft material exists, but it is fragmented and not consolidated into the canonical Doc 2 form).

**Canonical target:**
- `docs/core/core-docs/2. prd-technical-spec-template.md`
- `docs/core/core-docs/2. prd-technical-spec-v2.0-draft.md` (consolidated draft focusing on canonical output + user-defined schemas)

**Current files (pieces of Doc 2):**
- `docs/_drifted/prd-v4.md` (largest integrated draft of the technical spec)
- `docs/_complete/ddl-plan.md` (detailed DDL plan for Phase 1/2)
- `docs/core/core-docs/immutable-final.md` (final/verified immutable schema JSON structure)
- `docs/core/core-docs/2. prd-technical-spec-v1.0.md` (too small to be Doc 2 as defined by the template)

**What "done" looks like:**
- A single canonical Doc 2 in `docs/core/core-docs/` that:
  - Uses the Doc 2 template sections
  - Incorporates the resolved pieces above (identity model, storage model, tables, endpoints, export shape, security/RLS)
  - Captures and resolves the open questions currently listed at the top of `docs/_drifted/prd-v4.md`

---

### 3) Technical Spec - {component/feature} (Document 3) - PRESENT (guides next dev)

**Status:** Mostly complete for the current 3 major components (these are usable to begin development work).

**Current component specs:**
- `docs/core/core-docs/doc-3/supabase-core-pipeline-tech-spec.md`
- `docs/core/core-docs/doc-3/gcp-conversion-service-tech-spec.md`
- `docs/core/core-docs/doc-3/frontend-sveltekit-tech-spec.md`

**Notes:**
- These are explicitly present-oriented and should evolve as the system changes.
- They should not carry the long-term intent (Doc 1) or the final architecture spec (Doc 2); they should translate "as-is" into actionable next steps.

---

### 4) Implementation Status - {component/feature} (Document 4) - PRESENT (what exists now)

**Status:** Present and generally complete as status snapshots, but at least one is underspecified on verification details.

**Current status docs:**
- `docs/core/core-docs/doc-4/supabase-core-pipeline-status.md`
- `docs/core/core-docs/doc-4/gcp-conversion-service-status.md`
- `docs/core/core-docs/doc-4/frontend-sveltekit-status.md`

**Supporting operational status:**
- `docs/work-request/gcp-cloud-run-conversion-service-status.md` (detailed deployment + verification record; referenced by the Doc 4 conversion status)

**Primary gap:**
- `docs/core/core-docs/doc-4/supabase-core-pipeline-status.md` points to "scripts under scripts/" without naming the specific scripts/commands that prove the system is working end-to-end. This should be made concrete.

---

### 5) Roadmap (Document 5) - PRESENT + FUTURE (aggregate progress + phases)

**Status:** Missing (no canonical roadmap doc exists in `docs/` right now).

**Evidence of references, not a canonical doc:**
- Mentions of "roadmap" exist (e.g., `docs/core/ref/prdver-vs-intent.md`), but there is no dedicated Document 5 artifact.

**What "done" looks like:**
- A canonical roadmap doc that:
  - Aggregates the current Doc 4 statuses (what exists now)
  - Defines phases/milestones to reach Doc 1/2 end state
  - Serves as the single place to see "where we are" and "what's next"

---

## Non-Canonical / Needs Triage (Docs Hygiene)

These exist under `docs/core/core-docs/` but are not clearly one of the 5 canonical docs:

- `docs/core/core-docs/Defining Immutable Schema & Blocks.md` appears to be a chat transcript/log, not a finalized canonical doc.

This may be fine as reference, but it should be explicitly placed under `docs/core/ref/` (or similar) if the intent is to keep `core-docs/` as the canonical 1-5 set plus templates.
