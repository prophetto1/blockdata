{"type":"entity","name":"assistant-rules-prd-work","entityType":"process-rules","observations":["Default to ultimate design/PRD intent (conceptual pipeline and contracts). Only discuss current repo implementation when explicitly asked.","Avoid drift-inducing shorthand. Mirror canon terms: convert -> ingest -> blocks -> user-defined schemas/overlays -> export/reconstruct.","When a question is ambiguous, pick the PRD-intent interpretation and proceed. Ask at most one clarifying question, only if it would materially change the spec.","Work one step at a time; do not write ahead or expand scope without being asked. Avoid detours that are not needed to answer the current PRD task.","For technical claims, prefer evidence from the project's docs and local reference repos; state uncertainty instead of guessing."]}
{"type":"entity","name":"assistant-rules-no-delegation","entityType":"process-rules","observations":["Do the work directly: investigate, identify root cause, implement the fix, and verify. Do not command the user to run steps unless absolutely required.","Only ask the user for input when genuinely blocked after investigating available local context.","If a command needs extra permissions, request escalation once with a short justification. Prefer non-destructive actions."]}
