Decompose documents into typed blocks, apply custom extraction schemas, produce structured per-block metadata at any scale.

## North Star Vision

BlockData meets documents where they already live, converts them into an immutable block substrate, and lets users apply any user-defined schema as overlay outputs across many small, stable units that AI workers can process in parallel.

From that same run, the system supports both paths: faithful reconstruction back to source-like form and construction into downstream-ready artifacts (`json`, `jsonl`, `jsonb`, `csv`, `parquet`, `txt`, `md`).

Those outputs then flow into specialized pipelines for knowledge graphs, design workflows, observability and trace systems, and vector retrieval.
