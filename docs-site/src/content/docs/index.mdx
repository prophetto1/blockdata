title: BlockData Documentation
description: Internal documentation for the BlockData document intelligence platform.
---

BlockData decomposes uploaded documents into ordered, typed blocks and lets users apply custom extraction schemas so that AI workers produce structured, per-block metadata at any scale.

## How to use these docs

- **[Concepts](/docs/concepts/)** — The platform's core entities: Projects, Documents, Blocks, Schemas, Runs, Overlays, and Export. One page per entity, following the same hierarchy you see in the app.
- **[Workflows](/docs/workflows/)** — End-to-end task guides that mirror the app's user flow: upload, define a schema, process, review, export.
- **[Reference](/docs/reference/)** — Lookup tables for block types, immutable fields, enum registries, model specs, and overlay statuses.
- **[Architecture](/docs/architecture/)** — Under-the-hood design: parsing tracks, the batched worker protocol, the data model, and the staging layer.
- **[Integrations](/docs/integrations/)** — What you do with the output: fine-tuning datasets, knowledge graphs, analytics, and webhooks.
- **[Status](/docs/status/)** — Current platform state, the 9-phase roadmap, and changelog.
