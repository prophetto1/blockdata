These guides walk through the platform the way you actually use it. Each page maps to a real action in the app, in the order you'd take them.

## The pipeline

```
Setup → Upload → Schema → Process → Review → Export
```

1. **[Uploading Documents](/docs/workflows/uploading-documents/)** — Add files to a project, track conversion status
2. **[Creating Schemas](/docs/workflows/creating-schemas/)** — Define what the AI should extract from each block
3. **[Processing](/docs/workflows/processing/)** — Apply schemas, dispatch to the AI worker, monitor progress
4. **[Review and Confirm](/docs/workflows/review-and-confirm/)** — Inspect staged output in the grid, edit, confirm, reject
5. **[Exporting](/docs/workflows/exporting/)** — Download confirmed results as JSONL, CSV, or project-wide ZIP
