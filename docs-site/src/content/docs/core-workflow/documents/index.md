Documents in BlockData are defined by the immutable substrate derived at ingest time.

For the canonical identity model and export semantics, start here:
- [Canonical Export Contract](/docs/key-concepts/architecture/canonical-export/)
- [Immutable Fields](/docs/key-concepts/schemas/immutable-schema/)

Format routing and conversion details live in:
- [Ingest & Conversion](/docs/core-workflow/ingest-and-conversion/)
