Internal note: this repository’s active product surface is `web/` (with `front/` kept as reference-only), the canonical backend is Supabase (`supabase/functions` + `supabase/migrations`) with `services/conversion-service` handling parser conversion callbacks, current direction is to keep Supabase as system of record while adding an Arango projection for `blocks` and `doclingdocument_json`, and cleanup/migration work should stay cleanly split by concern (one section at a time), prioritize removal of non-essential repo artifacts, and phase away Mantine incrementally without cross-cutting rewrites.
